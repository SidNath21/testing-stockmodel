"Jul 27, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
In the thereafter. Not only his Operation Warp Speed, accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing’s happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously, so everything goes at one time. We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting. It’s all going at one time. We have a system that has, I think it’s unparalleled, has never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work and work very well. We’re mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one, that it’s approved, it will be available to the American people immediately and we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.
Donald Trump: (00:57)
The world is suffering from this China virus. Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed, is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over 100, including Remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact. You see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically. Dexamethazone, convalescent plasma and antibody treatments, we have numerous treatments right now that are under study. I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials, late stage. Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April.
Donald Trump: (01:59)
Think of that. 85%, and it’s 25% lower than Europe as a whole. In the middle of April, more than 22% of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down. As of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7%. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing. Very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They are pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially, more than 50%. Last week, our centers for Medicare and Medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care, diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.
Donald Trump: (03:00)
What we’ve already sent, includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point of care tests. It’s a tremendous amount. That’s, you’ll get your response and answer from five to 15 minutes. Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point of care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That’s more than all of Europe put together times two. Nobody’s even close, and as countries go, it is as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people. Through our relentless efforts, ` we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100,000,095 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face yields, and much, much more.
Donald Trump: (04:13)
In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month and we’ll distribute them. We have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need, other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus. Last week, FEMA sent additional personnel protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves and 6 million gowns. It’s a lot. Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona they’re heading very substantially down and rapidly. We’ve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources, when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full. We have everything we need. We get it to the states immediately.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
We deal with the governors. The relationship with the governors has been very good. These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly. We are working with every governor and health commissioner, across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendation. States are different. My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America however, the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or under-counted. I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases. Most of the world doesn’t. They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick or they just don’t report.
Donald Trump: (06:20)
Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly-infected countries outside of our borders. I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott, terrific gentlemen, and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators and half a million KN90 masks. Beginning this week, Texas hospitals, will receive 500 cases of Remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients. In addition to the cross border spread, the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease.
Donald Trump: (07:42)
We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance. I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions, to shield those at highest risk, which are in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus, especially, especially those that are really targeted, almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic pandemic. America will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates.
Donald Trump: (08:50)
I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina. Is a great place. It’s a phenomenal place. We’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time. I want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I’m there. When they call, most of them, many of them are sitting here right now. I will always answer their call. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here with us and let’s get onto a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before. Please, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 3: (09:41)
There’s been a lot of despair when it comes to the virus. Is today’s event about giving Americans hope, a sense of optimism? Is that what you’re trying to do?
Donald Trump: (09:53)
Well, I think so. But there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren’t doing so well where, before, just before I left the White House in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they’re making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we’ll have some really very good things to say. We’re just having great answers. It is about that. It’s also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length, is just coming along really well. It’s not just one company. It’s many companies have had tremendous progress. That’ll be announced over the next very short period.
Speaker 5: (10:35)
When do you expect the vaccine to be ready for the Americans to-
Donald Trump: (10:35)
Well, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we’re in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we’re going to, in terms of the vaccine, I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning you go and you give somebody, whether it’s transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal and they heal quickly. We’ve had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at Remdesivir and you look at some of the other things, but we’ll have some announcements on that over the next two weeks. Yeah, it is hope, but it’s only hope because we’ve gotten such incredible results, scientifically.
Speaker 5: (11:15)
One final question.
Donald Trump: (11:17)
Yeah.
Speaker 5: (11:17)
You did talk with Russian President, Vladimir Putin. I wanted to ask, if you did bring up the reports of Russia, having [inaudible 00:11:24] on our soldiers, in Afghanistan.
Donald Trump: (11:25)
We don’t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion and I think it was very productive. Please.
Speaker 7: (11:32)
Larry Kudlow, earlier today said that the V-shape recovery is showing signs of moderating. Do you think given what we’re seeing with the increase in cases that the recovery could be in jeopardy at all, the economic recovery?
Donald Trump: (11:43)
I don’t think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We’ve set record job numbers. We’ve set record numbers, whether it’s a pure V or a little bit less than that, I think it’s going to be very good. If therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you’re going to have a tremendous recovery, likewise, with the vaccines. If you do that by the end of the year, that’s ahead of schedule, substantially ahead of schedule and it’s ahead of anything that’s ever taken place in terms of vaccines before. I think if those things happen, if just one of those events happen, you’ll go right back into that V and I think you’re probably in the V anyway,. I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening. We’ll see what happens with them, but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically, I think you’re going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise. Yeah. Please go ahead. In the back.
Zachary Eanes: (12:37)
Zachary Eanes, from the Raleigh News and Observer. Now that you’ve canceled the Jacksonville portion of the RNC, do you think Governor Cooper made the right choice to limiting attendance in Charlotte?
Donald Trump: (12:48)
Well, we’re actually coming to North Carolina as you know. We’re having a very major, I guess that would be the nomination night. That’s a Monday. That’ll be Monday. They’re going to be here and the rest we’ll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing and I’m really happy that we’re going to be having a piece of it, at least in a very important piece in North Carolina. Yes, please go ahead.
Speaker 9: (13:14)
Mr. President, your poll numbers suffered in recent months because of your handling on this pandemic. You’re here now today. What’s your plan going forward to prove to Americans that you’re the right person?
Donald Trump: (13:24)
I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Arizona, our numbers. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We’re leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it’s a terrible thing when you look at it. But I had the same thing four years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn’t going to win any state. I ended up winning every one of them. The swing States, I wasn’t going to win any of them and I want all of them. I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer.
Donald Trump: (14:06)
They have it closer, but it’s the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states, by even more than I won in ’16. When you look at Florida as an example, you have thousands of boats out of the ocean, out on the Intercoastal. You look at other states, where likewise, you have thousands of boats and their all waving the Trump sign, Trump/Pence sign, and they’re so proud. Thousands and thousands. You have seen it where you have bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends. I think there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been for my campaign. That includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there’s more today because what we’ve done nobody’s ever done before.
Donald Trump: (15:01)
Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes, the most in our history, created the greatest economy we’ve ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody’s ever done. All of these different things, the VA, we got VA choice. We got VA, everything for the VA right now. They had a 91% approval rating. In a recent poll, I was just speaking to the secretary. 91% in the VA, that’s never happened before. I think when people see all that we’ve done, even Space Force, we created a force that actual, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, right? It’s pretty amazing. Coast guard. Now, Space Force. That hasn’t happened in 75 years. What we’ve done, working with some of those warriors over there, by the way, but what we’ve done has never been done. If you look at Alaska with ANWR, perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton, everybody wanted to get it done.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
I got it done. ANWR in Alaska, probably, or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. Now, what we’ve done has been incredible. Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. By the way, gasoline prices for everyone, a very, very low. In many cases, less than $2. That’s pretty incredible. I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone and they cut way back and we’re now at $40 and plus a barrel. We’re saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We’re the number one in energy in the world. With all that we’ve done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history.
Donald Trump: (16:54)
We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again, and everyone knows I’m going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn’t close I,. You would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more than that, what you have. We closed this greatest economy ever, far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they’ve had. Think of it. In 67 years. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. I had to close it and now we’re reopening it. Next year we’ll be stronger. It’ll be the strongest year so far. It’ll be better even than last year.
Donald Trump: (17:46)
Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll be heading back. I’ll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We’re going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders. Thank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you."
"Jul 25, 2020","Dave Portnoy: (00:35)
Your son’s a big fan of our website.
Donald Trump: (00:37)
He’s a big fan of you.
Dave Portnoy: (00:39)
Even before this started, I was trying to get a retweet out of him for about six months.
Donald Trump: (00:43)
We’ll do that.
Dave Portnoy: (00:44)
Well, you got me one on one, but he’d DM me, I’d be like, “Okay, get the old man to get a retweet. Get the numbers up, then we’ll talk business.”
Donald Trump: (00:51)
Well, you’re doing pretty well on that [crosstalk 00:00:53] .
Dave Portnoy: (00:52)
Yeah. Well, so are you.
Donald Trump: (00:53)
Yeah, we are. We have good numbers.
Dave Portnoy: (00:56)
I consider myself, believe it or not, apolitical. I don’t consider myself wildly Republican, Democrat, caught down in the middle. In fact, this is my first interview I’ve ever done, so I started at the top.
Donald Trump: (01:06)
You started very well, that’s good.
Dave Portnoy: (01:07)
I was going to give you the heads up, I don’t know if you can remember this. You once were on Ali G’s show, and you were the only one that sniffed out that was a fake interview and the whole thing. I don’t know if you remember that. I thought maybe you’d be like, “Oh, this guy is a fake.”
Donald Trump: (01:19)
Were you involved with that show in some way?
Dave Portnoy: (01:21)
No, not at all. I just watched it on TV.
Donald Trump: (01:23)
But you’re right, I was the only one-
Dave Portnoy: (01:24)
30 seconds, in and out.
Donald Trump: (01:25)
All these guys, I said, “Hey, this guy is a total fraud,” and I left, and then I found out.
Dave Portnoy: (01:28)
And everyone else sits there for six hours, I know.
Donald Trump: (01:30)
You’re the only one that’s ever given me credit for that.
Dave Portnoy: (01:33)
That was a very sharp move because he’s pretty good at that. He gets everybody.
Donald Trump: (01:37)
Now I like this interview. No matter what he does it, I like this interview now, Mariano. That’s right. I said, “What’s going on with this guy?” I just felt it was a phony deal.
Dave Portnoy: (01:47)
Yeah. And nobody else did it. Nobody else smelled it out.
Donald Trump: (01:50)
He said he was from British Broadcasting Corporation. They called up with everything, beautiful, the voices, “This is British Broadcast …” And then this guy shows up, I said, “This is a …” like immediately. And thank you very much, you gave me credit.
Dave Portnoy: (02:03)
On it, good.
Donald Trump: (02:03)
Because I never get credit for anything good.
Dave Portnoy: (02:05)
I’m pretty good, that’s what I’m saying.
Donald Trump: (02:07)
You’re pretty good. I like you.
Dave Portnoy: (02:08)
And here’s part of it, I hate politics, my dad loves politics. The thing that drives me nuts is I feel like for us, which is good, they’re like, “Hey Dave, you’re a snowflake.” “Hey Dave, you’re a conservative, white, crazy person.” And almost on each side, you can predict what somebody is going to say, which drives me nuts. It’s like you put it in a box. So one of the things that I’ve been thinking about, and for all the people like me, which I think a good amount of the country is still like, “Which way am I going to vote?” One of the things that I have a question for, and again, I think it matters. I’m very curious on the answer.
Dave Portnoy: (02:38)
When the Kaepernick thing started, I was critical of it. And as it’s continued, baseball players now, I heard you say, if they kneel, you’ll turn the game off. And we’ve got the Black Lives Matter protests, so for me, how does somebody who’s dissatisfied, in your world, what’s the way for them to show it? Because we don’t want them looting and doing all the stuff they’re doing. To me, that’s a silent protest that is far better than going out on the streets and create crime. So I’m curious, what would you do if you had an issue with the country or something to show your displeasure?
Donald Trump: (03:11)
Well, I mean, you can always say you run for office, right? You become successful. You could run for a lower office, you can do things, but there are ways. You get groups together and there can be very friendly ways of doing it, very successful. I mean, you’re going to have negative rebounds if it keeps up the way it is. As an example of Portland, this is crazy. 51 days, we sent in very powerful, not military but very strong people. The police are good but they were told not to do anything by the radical left mayor. Now you have to go out and speak your mind. I think speaking your mind is good, but you have to do it fairly. We are for justice, but we’re for law and order. It’s got to be law and order, and there is law and order.
Donald Trump: (03:55)
I put something out when they were starting to rip down statues. I went out, I found an old law, an old bill, you couldn’t get it passed today. You get 10 years in jail. 10 years and no games, and we have a lot of people in jail right now. If you ripped down a federal statue, because the states have to take care of their own, unfortunately, because I’d do that too, but you rip down a federal statue you get 10 years in jail. 10 years, no three months, and nothing’s happened since then. It was amazing. I signed it. I had a news conference. I said, “If you do it …” And we were supposed to have thousands of people march on Washington that day, nobody showed up.
Dave Portnoy: (04:33)
How do we close the divide? At my age it just seems half the country hates the other half, and no matter what you say, they can’t get along. And you’re the lightning rod, there is no doubt about that in my mind. Do you agree with that? That you’re like a lightning rod.
Donald Trump: (04:46)
Sometimes for a purpose. I mean, but-
Dave Portnoy: (04:49)
How do we bring it together so the two sides right now that are at heads can be like, “You are my guy.”
Donald Trump: (04:53)
I think it was happening, and then we got hit by the China Virus. I think it was happening, success. Our country never did better. The best employment numbers in the history of our country. Best unemployment numbers, African American, Asian, American, Hispanic American, everybody, best unemployment numbers in history, Best stock market we’ve ever had. Although I must tell you, as you know probably very well, the stock market is almost at the same level right now, which a great tribute.
Dave Portnoy: (05:22)
I wasn’t watching it today. That’s why I went down today. I’ve been killing the stock market.
Donald Trump: (05:26)
But the stock market has been absolutely great.
Dave Portnoy: (05:28)
Yep, great since March.
Donald Trump: (05:29)
A lot of things are happening. Great housing numbers the other day, great everything. We’re doing really well. We’re trying to get rid of the rest of this pandemic, but success does it, and we were ready to do it. Because if you look at, when you say Hispanic, or when you say African American, Asian American, they were all working. Everybody was making a lot of money. Everybody was doing good, and it was coming together, and then China sent us this horrible, bad present, a real bad present. They could have stopped it. They should’ve stopped it. We made a trade deal with China, and it was a great deal, but it means much less to me now than it did then, because I’m not happy with what they’ve done to the world. They stopped it going into China from Wuhan, but they didn’t stop it going into Europe, the United States and the rest of the world.
Donald Trump: (06:19)
But we were ready to do it, and the word is success, and I think we’re going to have that. I think we’re going to have a great next year. You’ll be able to see the results before the election, which is interesting because the election is November 3rd, at the beginning of November, the numbers are going to come out for the third quarter. I predict those numbers are going to be really great, despite the fact that Democrats want to keep their areas closed because they want the numbers to be bad.
Dave Portnoy: (06:46)
Right, they politicized it.
Donald Trump: (06:46)
I mean, can you imagine?
Dave Portnoy: (06:46)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (06:48)
I know how you feel about that. I think a big part of the reason they do it is for politics.
Dave Portnoy: (06:56)
I don’t know whether a Black Lives Matter person would be like, “Well, the economy, great, but we still want the president to come out, whether it be Twitter or whatever, and have our back.” So that’s where the kneeling and things like that seems like such a small concession, and the thing to be like, “Yep, Donald’s our guy.”
Donald Trump: (07:12)
I don’t like the kneeling. I must be honest with you, I don’t like the kneeling. I didn’t like it for the NFL. I think there are many ways of showing you’re unhappy, because when the NFL was happening-
Dave Portnoy: (07:24)
I hate Goodell, by the way.
Donald Trump: (07:24)
I know, exactly. I know that. I’ve heard that actually. I don’t know why he did it. In the middle of the summer, all of a sudden, sitting in a T-shirt in his basement, he came out with this thing that nobody was even thinking about it.
Dave Portnoy: (07:35)
He spiked at it. That’s vintage Goodell. Nobody was talking about it, and he brought it back to the forefront.
Donald Trump: (07:42)
I don’t understand. He’s talking in the middle of the summer, he comes out and he’s sitting there and he looked nice, but I wouldn’t say like Mariano. He looked nice in his T-shirt. I don’t know if I’d look much worse than that to be honest with you. I wouldn’t wear a T-shirt. I think he would’ve looked better in a suit and tie.
Dave Portnoy: (07:58)
That’s why your Twitter game is strong.
Donald Trump: (08:00)
No, he would have looked better in a suit and tie. If I had any advice, number one, he could have waited until at least the fall. But more importantly, I would have worn a suit or a tie or even an open shirt that’s loose, not tight.
Dave Portnoy: (08:11)
I got you.
Donald Trump: (08:12)
Okay. So he came out with this thing, Dave, and everyone was saying, “Where did this come from now?” And the whole big thing started, and he’s made a mistake.
Dave Portnoy: (08:23)
I actually have a question on your presidential power. So you may not know this, but during the NFL draft, he said, “I’m going to do a charity auction, and somebody can sit in my basement, watch Monday Night Football with me, and the charity will go to COVID.” Well, I bid. And one, I spent $250,000 to win that chart. I won it fair and square, he rejected it.
Donald Trump: (08:41)
Well, he wanted no part of you, obviously.
Dave Portnoy: (08:44)
I know. I don’t know if you can arrest the guy for that.
Donald Trump: (08:45)
No, but I think it was a wise move.
Dave Portnoy: (08:47)
Yeah, by him.
Donald Trump: (08:48)
It was a very smart move he did.
Dave Portnoy: (08:49)
That’s the first nice thing you said about him.
Donald Trump: (08:51)
Look, he’s working hard and everything, but it’s a strange thing.
Dave Portnoy: (08:53)
He’s the most overpaid guy in the history of human beings.
Donald Trump: (08:56)
Well, he makes a lot of money.
Dave Portnoy: (08:57)
A lot of money for a job that a lot of people could do. All right, I have to ask this question because we followed. When you meet world leaders, you stick the handshake on them, and it looks like you’re going for the power move. Is that intentional?
Donald Trump: (09:08)
Before COVID, right now I guess-
Dave Portnoy: (09:09)
Right, now you can’t. This is pre-COVID.
Donald Trump: (09:11)
He’s the one, the only one I’ve shaken hands with in a long time. You, because you stuck your hand out, and I’m saying, “What are we doing?” But I shook your hand. You were tested?
Dave Portnoy: (09:20)
I was tested when I came in here.
Donald Trump: (09:21)
Otherwise they’d take you out right now. They’ll end the interview. Did you notice that? He stuck his hand out and I said, “What do I do here?” Rather than insult him, I said fine.
Dave Portnoy: (09:32)
I appreciated that. I don’t even think-
Donald Trump: (09:32)
Hey, I immediately ran, washed my hands, no. In the days, like four months ago, I just … People don’t know that I get along really great with the world leaders. I’m tougher with the world leaders than any president’s been. I’ve been tougher on Russia by far with the pipeline, with our military, with the oil. Now the number one energy producer in the world, and there’s nobody even close. I’ve been very tough with Russia. I mean, China, nobody’s been tough like me with China. And that’s not to be tough, that’s because for years they’ve taken advantage. So many countries, not those two only, the whole world, our allies, NATO, the whole world has taken advantage of our country.
Donald Trump: (10:16)
But despite that, I have a very good relationship with leaders. I mean-
Dave Portnoy: (10:20)
Because of the handshake?
Donald Trump: (10:21)
I shake their hand. I hug them.
Dave Portnoy: (10:24)
You power shake them.
Donald Trump: (10:25)
I have a lot of great … Abe of Japan, look, they’ve been ripping us off for years and years. They send the cars in, there’s no tax. We send a car to them, they say, “We don’t take your cars.” This is the kind of thing that we’ve put up with. We defend these countries, we get nothing for it. I’ve ended a lot of the craziness that’s gone on.
Dave Portnoy: (10:44)
Do you love doing Twitter?
Donald Trump: (10:46)
There are times when I love it, too much sometimes, right?
Dave Portnoy: (10:49)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (10:49)
Where’s Dan? I think we have-
Speaker 5: (10:51)
He’s right there.
Donald Trump: (10:52)
Dan, what’s our number now, total?
Dan: (10:57)
207 million.
Donald Trump: (10:57)
Can you believe it?
Dave Portnoy: (10:57)
What happens to those Twitter accounts? Is it yours when it’s over? Do you lose all this?
Donald Trump: (11:01)
It’s mine. I don’t know if I’ll ever use it again, but it certainly was good. It’s a platform … Look, we have fake news. You don’t know about that, but we have fake news out there.
Dave Portnoy: (11:10)
I very much know about that. That exists in my world as well.
Donald Trump: (11:13)
And then, Dave, we have a very big voice. When you have the kind of numbers that we have, you’re able to get the word out and an honest word, and it’s important. So it’s been very important for me.
Dave Portnoy: (11:26)
Because I follow you on Twitter, and I know I do this, but I’m not the pre … well, my nickname is El pres, but I’m a company, so we’re doing it. Do you ever tweet out and wake up like, “Oh man, I wish I didn’t send that one out.”
Donald Trump: (11:38)
Too often.
Donald Trump: (11:40)
In the old days, before this, you’d write a letter and you’d say, “This letter is really bad,” you put it on your desk and then you go back tomorrow and you say, “Oh, I’m glad I didn’t send it,” right? But we don’t do that with Twitter. We put it out instantaneously. We feel great, and then you start getting phone calls, “Did you really say this?” I say, “What’s wrong with that?” And you find a lot of things. You know what I find? It’s not the tweets, it’s the retweets that get you in trouble.
Dave Portnoy: (12:05)
You’ve been caught retweeting, and people be like, “Oh, he just retweeted this crazy person,” so you don’t even look, you just press retweet. You just fire from the hip.
Donald Trump: (12:12)
You see something that looks good and you don’t investigate it, and you don’t look at what’s on the helmet exactly, which is in miniature and you don’t blow it up, and sometimes it’s … I have found almost always, it’s the retweets that get you in trouble.
Dave Portnoy: (12:28)
I’ve seen that a little bit with you. We got opening day today.
Donald Trump: (12:32)
Good.
Dave Portnoy: (12:32)
Fauci is throwing out the first pitch, can you give him any tips? You think he’s going to be able to. I mean, he seems like a little guy. I’ve never seen him. Are you expecting a good pitch here.
Donald Trump: (12:39)
Well, they say he was a good basketball player, and he is a very nice guy.
Dave Portnoy: (12:42)
How tall is he?
Donald Trump: (12:44)
Well, he was not tall, but he was a fast little guard, and they say he was a good basketball player. He’s actually a very nice guy. We don’t always agree on everything. He’d like to do things that I don’t like to do, but ultimately I make the decision, but we make it all a group of people. And he’s been here for like 45 years, for many, many years, and he’s a nice man actually.
Dave Portnoy: (13:07)
I’m a sports guy. The company that bought us Penn National are a gambling company, so sports gambling is a big part of what we do. I switched to the stock market actually, day trading. Fauci is on my X list, because every time he talks and says the country should stay inside, my stocks tank, so I don’t like that aspect of it.
Donald Trump: (13:22)
Well, he’d like to see it closed up for a couple of years, but that’s okay because I’m president, so I say, “Well, I appreciate your opinion, now give me another opinion, somebody please.”
Dave Portnoy: (13:30)
Yeah, you overruled.
Donald Trump: (13:31)
Well, you have to. Now we’re open and we’re doing well, and I just had a press conference about opening the schools. You’ve got to open the schools. They have a stronger immune system even than you have, or I have, the kids.
Dave Portnoy: (13:42)
That’s not saying much for me.
Donald Trump: (13:43)
That’s not saying much?
Dave Portnoy: (13:43)
No.
Donald Trump: (13:45)
But they do. They have it. It’s amazing. You look at the percentage, it’s a tiny percentage of 1%. And in that one case, I mean, I looked at a couple of cases, if you have diabetes, if you have problems with something, but the kids are in great shape. So we want to open the schools and we’re opening the country. We had great numbers announced the other day. And two weeks ago, we had the biggest number of jobs we’ve ever had. And the month before that, we had the same thing. A lot of good things are happening, and I think it looks like a V. We have a lot of people that would like to see their states closed. I have a feeling on November 4th, they’ll open them up. I think they want to do it for political reasons, but we’re doing well.
Donald Trump: (14:24)
The polls are starting to really shape up. Dave, we were doing great. We were sailing. George Washington would have had a hard time beating us. And then when the China virus came in, all of a sudden, it’s a dampener, it really is.
Dave Portnoy: (14:37)
Well, COVID is bad.
Donald Trump: (14:38)
Well, it’s a downer, though, psychologically. It went down, and now we’re really starting to do well. We’re looking really good at a lot of different places.
Dave Portnoy: (14:49)
I’m sure you’ve been asked this. It’s one of the questions that I had when I was thinking of what I would ask you here, because you theoretically, for somebody like me, who’s sports, entertainment, having fun, you had the dream life, seemingly. And there’s a part of me that’s like, “I wonder if he ever,” and I know the answer is going to be no, “Regrets it.” Because now, I mean, you’re the most famous person in the world. My guess is nobody ever said, “Hey, I don’t like Donald Trump before he became president,” but now everyone has an opinion and your life has changed forever when seemingly you had the dream life beforehand.
Donald Trump: (15:19)
I was in so many rap songs, like 79 or something. I was in every rap. This is before I did this, right? It’s a very interesting thing that you say, because the best day in my life in terms of business and life and everything was the day before I announced I’m running for president. Everything was good. The company was good. I had finished up a lot of jobs that were very successful, and then I said, “I want to do this.” Now, I’m really glad I did, but I was treated very unfairly with fake Russia. Russia, Russia, Russia. Ukraine, Ukraine, all fake stuff. It’s a very vicious business.
Donald Trump: (15:58)
Somebody said, “Who’s the toughest in the world to deal with? Is it Russia? Is it China? Could it be North Korea?” I said, “No, the toughest is the United States. It’s the toughest to deal with.” When you look at what I have to do, I have to focus on the big picture, but I also have to focus … I have so many people on the left or call them Democrats, call them whatever you want, and then you look at what they’re doing with cities. Every city is run by a liberal Democrat and they’re going to hell, and we have to do something. We just sent people into Chicago. We sent people into Portland, as we said. We’re sending people into New York to help out. It’s incredible, but I love doing it. There was this phony deal that I was devastated when I won, because I couldn’t have my life. I had a great life, I did.
Donald Trump: (16:49)
One thing that happened, I was going into a thing called the Robin Hood Foundation. I’ll never forget it. It was just about the night I announced or whatever. And my wife looked at me, she said, “I hear people booing.” And she was with me for a long time. We’ve been together a long time. She said, “Some people are booing.” I said, “Yeah, but some people were also clapping wildly.” She said, “You know what, I’ve been with you a long time, I’ve never heard anyone boo you.” This was right after I started being the politician. It meant something because I said it’s the first time in my life I was ever booed. You know this.
Dave Portnoy: (17:23)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (17:24)
I’d go to Yankee stadium, people would go … Who is a 100%? But it was pretty close. And now, I would say this, I have more fervor on the one side, and I have far more animosity on the other side.
Dave Portnoy: (17:39)
That’s the vibe I get, “This is my DNA, but I’m now president.” I feel like so many interviews, they’re always coming from an agenda, positive or negative, and what noticed, I think, they come at you hard, you just come back harder. And that’s a very different thing for the president. I mean, I’m the president of Barstool, but people would say, is it presidential? Is it not? And you just do your thing and it wins. I wondered that. Here’s a hypothetical, if the perfect candidate, let’s not say Republican, Democrat, came along and said, “If we make him president, this country is going to be prosperous, everyone will get along.” Would you step aside?
Donald Trump: (18:12)
I mean, I don’t know that such a person exists.
Dave Portnoy: (18:12)
Probably not.
Donald Trump: (18:15)
And I should say yes, absolutely, I would. So let me say it that way, because that’s a much more politically correct? Absolutely.
Dave Portnoy: (18:22)
You’re not known to be politically correct.
Donald Trump: (18:23)
But it doesn’t work that way, because it just doesn’t, unfortunately. I really believe success. We were there. Everybody was working. Nobody’s … Probably you, I don’t know how you’re doing now, but you were probably doing better four months ago.
Dave Portnoy: (18:40)
Well, I got into the stock market right when it went up.
Donald Trump: (18:42)
Okay. Well, you got in at the right time, but a lot of people with the 401(k), I mean, they’re doing phenomenally. But a lot of people sold stock, and now they’re saying, “I missed it.” I said to people, “Don’t sell. Just don’t sell. Because the foundation is so strong, don’t sell.” But the people that really lost in terms of economic are the people that got out. The people that stayed in, they stayed with me, they’re doing great, and we’re almost at record highs.
Dave Portnoy: (19:09)
Okay. The last thing, and I’m going to wrap this up. And this, we asked for permission, you can say no if you don’t want to do it. My dad and I have had debates forever. He’s not the biggest fan of yours, what I want to do is kind of a prank. He doesn’t know I’m even here, but we’ve talked a lot. I want to call him, FaceTime him, and just he’d die if he saw that I was with you.
Donald Trump: (19:27)
Go ahead. You can do it quickly, right?
Dave Portnoy: (19:28)
Yeah. It’ll take two seconds. He knows it’s coming. This is going to be a-
Donald Trump: (19:31)
Oh, he does, that’s bad. That’s too bad.
Dave Portnoy: (19:36)
Well, this is going to be absolutely great. Let me get the thing here. I have it all set. This will take two seconds. Dad, this is going to be-
Donald Trump: (19:42)
Is he a good dad?
Dave Portnoy: (19:44)
He’s a great dad.
Donald Trump: (19:45)
Good.
Dave Portnoy: (19:47)
All right. I’ll put you on with-
Donald Trump: (19:48)
Don’t worry about socially distancing.
Dave Portnoy: (19:50)
No, I’ll come further. Hey, I got a question for you, what would you ask this guy, dad?
Speaker 7: (19:58)
I know. Trista sent me something, so I’m not shocked.
Dave Portnoy: (20:03)
The goal was to shock you. We’ve had a very good interview.
Donald Trump: (20:06)
And you have a very talented son, good guy.
Speaker 7: (20:11)
Really?
Dave Portnoy: (20:11)
That’s all he’s got.
Donald Trump: (20:14)
He’s honest. You have an honest father.
Speaker 7: (20:15)
I was wondering why you were pinning me down. Mr. President, he never calls me.
Donald Trump: (20:23)
That’s no good.
Dave Portnoy: (20:24)
There it is.
Speaker 7: (20:24)
I haven’t heard from him, unsolicited, in a long time.
Dave Portnoy: (20:29)
Well, there you go. You just needed a meeting with the president.
Speaker 7: (20:31)
I knew something was going on, sir. I knew something was going on, and I’m not shocked, although I didn’t expect to see your face just now.
Donald Trump: (20:39)
It’s great to see you.
Speaker 7: (20:40)
Can you get him to call me a little more.
Donald Trump: (20:42)
I’m going to put a lot of pressure on him. He’ll call you today in a little while.
Dave Portnoy: (20:45)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (20:46)
Thank you very much.
Dave Portnoy: (20:47)
All right, dad.
Donald Trump: (20:47)
Great to meet you.
Speaker 7: (20:47)
Thank you, sir.
Dave Portnoy: (20:48)
He handled that better than I thought he would. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (20:50)
He was really good. I was really worried about that. He was nice.
Dave Portnoy: (20:52)
He got tipped off, so this must’ve been leaked. I don’t know how.
Donald Trump: (20:54)
He was nice. Dave, thank you very much.
Dave Portnoy: (20:54)
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Oh, can’t do it.
Donald Trump: (20:57)
A great honor."
"Jul 24, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:02)
Well thank you very much everybody. Please. This promises to be a very big and very important meeting, so bear with me. Take a little while, but it has to do with a thing called drug pricing and as you know Congress has been working on this for decades and decades and we are now doing something that is going to be incredible for the American public. So today I’m taking a bold and historic, very dramatic action to reduce the price of prescription drugs for American patients and American seniors. Previous administrations did nothing, absolutely nothing, as drug lobbyists, special interests in foreign countries [inaudible 00:00:51] ripped off our citizens. Under the last administration alone, drug prices rose a staggering 55%. Thanks to my administration’s aggressive actions since taking office, we have successfully lowered drug prices for the first time in 51 years, but this reduction is still not close to what I want, what I expect, and I’m looking for help for our great seniors especially in particular, that’s what we’re doing today. You’ll hear something which will be very shocking, we’re doing things that nobody thought could be done and it’s going to have an incredible impact.
Donald Trump: (01:33)
Unfortunately we’ve been waiting for Congress to take action for many decades to reduce drug prices for more than just a small handful of people, but even the small handful of people never got price reductions, and I’m unwilling to wait any longer. Therefore today I’m signing four sweeping executive orders that will lead to a massive reduction in drug costs, massive. We’ve already gotten them down a little bit, but that’s not good enough, first time in 51 years as I said, but that’s not good enough. They represent the most far-reaching prescription drug reforms ever issued by a president. Nothing even close.
Donald Trump: (02:17)
Joining us for this important occasion are our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex, where’s Alex? Alex, thank you, Alex Azar. CMS administrator, both doing a great job, Seema Verma. Seema, thank you Seema. FDA administrator Dr. Stephen Hahn, Stephen who is really speeding up the process of therapeutics and vaccines and I just heard from some of the big drug companies in there saying the FDA has really been moving the process along. Very important, Stephen. Can you move faster please? Okay. Thank you, great job. We appreciate it. And administrator of Health Resources and Service Administration Tom Engels. Tom, thank you. Thank you very much Tom for being here.
Donald Trump: (03:10)
We’re also pleased to have with us our great governor from the state of Florida, incredible state, incredible guy, Governor Ron DeSantis, thank you Ron very much. Appreciate it and you’re going to say a few words in the end, good. Representative Matt Gaetz, our friend. Where is … Hi Matt, you’re so quiet back there today. I’ve never seen you like that. Thank you Matt, great job you’re doing. Appreciate it very much. Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Jose Oliva. Jose, thank you Jose very much, good job, and many other state and local leaders, we have a lot of them. Thank you very much being here.
Donald Trump: (03:52)
The four orders I’m signing today will completely restructure the prescription drug market in terms of pricing and everything else to make these medications affordable and accessible for all Americans. The first order will require federal community health centers to pass the giant discounts they receive from drug companies on insulin and EpiPens directly to their patients. You know, insulin became so expensive people weren’t able to use it. They desperately needed it. We have it to a level that you’re not going to believe. EpiPens, likewise. You’ve been reading horrible stories about EpiPens over the last six, seven years. Horrible, horrible, horrible increases, where they went from almost nothing to massive amounts of money. We’re changing that right now. These providers should not be receiving discounts for themselves while charging their poorest patients massive full prices. Under this order the price of insulin for affected patients will come down to just pennies a day, pennies a day from numbers that you weren’t able to think about. It’s a massive cost savings.
Donald Trump: (05:08)
The second executive order I’m signing this afternoon will allow states, wholesalers and pharmacies to do something other politicians have promised for decades and decades but never done. They never delivered. We will finally allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries where the price for the identical drug is incredibly lower. It’s a difference like you wouldn’t believe. 70%, 80%, 90%, 30%, but massively lower than the identical drug made in the same plant, the same factory, the same exact drug, same everything, same box, same pill, and yet it’s 50, 60, 70% lower and this is something that Ron and I have been discussing from the time Ron got elected and I’ve been wanting to do it and it takes a long time from a legal standpoint and we’ve got it all worked out.
Donald Trump: (06:17)
So we are going to be getting massive drug savings in Florida and other states and we’ve had numerous states that wanted to do it. Ron really was at the forefront, I will say that, but you have other states that have caught on, it’s caught on very quickly. Didn’t take them long to figure that one out, Ron. It’s too obvious. We pay for all of the research and all of the developments and foreign countries pay absolutely nothing and our consumer gets charged. This has been going on for decades. The American people pay an average of over three times more for medicine than the Canadians. Many people go to Canada, I see it all the time, they go to Canada, buy drugs and then they come back, prescription drugs because they save so much money. The trip is well worth it.
Donald Trump: (07:03)
The Obama-Biden administration pledged to end this unfairness and allow drug importation but they never got it done. They were unable to get it done. They didn’t get a lot of things done, but under my administration we’re standing up to the lobbyists and special interests and fighting back against a rigged system. Rigged system, you’ve heard that word before. I am unrigging the system that is many decades old. We’re doing something that should have been done a long time ago.
Donald Trump: (07:35)
The third revolutionary order I’m signing today will prevent middlemen and women I guess, but you’ve heard about the middleman, right? The middleman that makes so much money, nobody knows who they are, nobody has any idea who they are, they make more money perhaps than even the drug companies themselves, and the drug companies in all fairness to them, big pharma and they’re doing a great job on the vaccines, they’re doing a great job on therapeutics I can tell you because I deal with them a lot, but I think the middlemen make more money than they do and they don’t do much. Maybe they don’t do anything. Some people say they don’t do anything. Nobody even knows who they are, but the middlemen are making a fortune and pharmacy benefit managers and people are just bilking Medicare patients with these high drug prices while they pocket gigantic discounts, gigantic discounts. The amount of money they have made over the decades is too incredible even to speculate or say, it’s massive.
Donald Trump: (08:48)
Some very rich people are not going to like me very much today, I can tell you. I probably know them very well, I probably see them in Palm Beach, but nobody ever talks about who they are. Everyone, I hear the middlemen for years, the middlemen. Right Alex? He doesn’t know who they are either but he knows they’re rich. They’re not going to be so rich anymore because the money is going down to reduce the price of drugs, prescription drugs. So that’s a big thing. That’s a tremendous step. It should have been taken a long time ago but they have a great deal of power and I don’t have to tell you how many phone calls I’ve had in the last few days when they heard I was going to be doing this. I’ve heard from people that I haven’t spoken to in a long time. Frequently drug companies give these middlemen discounts of up to 50% on the price of prescription drugs, but too often those discounts are not passed on to the pharmacy counter, meaning the people. This rule will pass, those billions and billions of dollars a year, I mean many, many billions a year in discounts onto patients, directly onto patients, saving Americans with high drug costs thousands of dollars a year. Individual people will make thousands of dollars a year.
Donald Trump: (10:11)
You’re not going to believe the impact the things we’re talking about today are going to have. Mark Meadows, our great chief is sitting here and he’s just … Can’t even believe it because he was a very successful congressman, he’s been after people to do this for a long time and they never got to the gate. I understand why, tremendous pressure. Tremendous pressure put on the president not to do it.
Donald Trump: (10:35)
The fourth and final order I’m signing today is the granddaddy of them all. We’ll end global freeloading on the backs of American patients and American seniors. For decades, our citizens have paid the highest prices for drugs, prescription drugs anywhere in the world and it’s not even close. Foreign nations have paid vastly less
Donald Trump: (11:03)
“Foreign nations have paid vastly less for the exact same drug again, and the exact same box, from the exact same plant, from the exact same company. They would pay 10%, 20%, 30% what our people are paying. A pill that would sell for $1 in certain countries, I won’t name them. They’re all allies, right? They call them allies. I call them so-called allies, but a pill that would cost a dollar could be 7, $8 in our country, same exact pill. We pay 80% more than nations like Germany, Canada and others for some of the most expensive medicines, identical in all respects. This means that Americans are funding the enormous cost of drug research and development for the entire planet. We are bearing the entire cost of all of this. They’re bearing none. They say, “This is what we’re going to pay.” In some cases, it’s a socialist country. So we’re paying to reduce drug prices in a socialist country. How does that work? How does that work?
Donald Trump: (12:21)
And these are things that should have been done a long time ago. And even from our standpoint, we would have done it more quickly, but we have to go through vast amounts of waiting periods, waiting times, and this is an incredible day. This is just a big day. It is a big day. I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time. We incredibly and foolishly bear the full cost of all research and development, which is massive. In all fairness to the drug companies, can take 15 years to get something approved, billions and billions of dollars for a simple drug. It also means that the US taxpayers are effectively subsidizing the socialist healthcare systems of foreign welfare states and many other countries. We will end that abuse and restore the principles of free enterprise, but this doesn’t even have to do with free enterprise. This has to do with common sense and courage, to be honest, and courage.
Donald Trump: (13:25)
Under this transformative order, Medicare will be required to purchase drugs at the same price as other countries pay. So we would pay four or five times more for a drug, we now pay … If somebody else pays $1 and we pay $5, we’re paying $1. Now what’s going to happen is their number will go up, our number will come very substantially down and we’ll all agree at two and a half or two or whatever the final number is. But if some country is paying wherever it may be in the world because they had a better negotiator, because they had smarter people that we have, and that’s what it’s all about. Maybe more honest people. Who knows? Could be a lot of things going, but we get now the lowest price anywhere in the world and no more will we have to suffer by saying, “Gee, why is it so much cheaper for the exact same drug in some other country?” We will determine what other medically advanced nations pay for the most expensive drugs. And instead of paying the highest price, Medicare will pay the lowest price and so will lots of other US buyers.
Donald Trump: (14:40)
Medicare is the largest purchase of drugs anywhere in the world by far. Medicare, largest purchaser of drugs in the world, and we’re finally going to use that incredible power to achieve a fairer and lower price for everyone. Everyone will get a fairer and much lower price. This is not talking about one half of a percent. This is big stuff. Under our ridiculous system, which has been broken for decades, we aren’t even allowed to negotiate the price of drugs. Can you believe it? I said, “When are we going to negotiate?” We’re not allowed. We’re restricted by Congress from negotiating the price of drugs. Can you imagine? You say, “I want to get a better price. Oh I’m sorry, sir. You’re not allowed to do that. That’s illegal.” What kind of a system is that? Do you think the world looks at us and said, “Where the hell did these people come from?” But they treat us very nicely. It’s going to end, okay? I see you’re a fan of what we’re saying. You must be a doctor. Are you a doctor? Yeah. Doctors know. The doctors know. You’ve known that for years. We’re not allowed to negotiate. Can you believe it? We just have to take whatever it is.
Donald Trump: (15:54)
I’m pleased to announce that as a result of the orders I’m signing today, the heads of the major drug companies have requested a meeting to discuss how we can quickly and significantly lower drug prices and out of pocket expenses for Americans. They want to do what’s right. Look, they’re going to do what’s right. Look, I think it’s so important what they’re doing on therapeutics and vaccines, and we’re going to see them on Tuesday. We’ll see if we can do something here, but this could have been done a long time ago. The drug company executives will be at the White House on Tuesday, and they have some ideas how to significantly reduce drug prices. We’ve already given them to you. I don’t know if they can possibly do something to substitute for what’s called favored nations. Favored nations, that means we get the lowest price anywhere in the world. Whoever gets the best price, congratulations. Thank you very much for being a good negotiator because we now get the lowest price too. Should have been done a long time ago.
Donald Trump: (16:58)
If these talks that are successful, we may not need to implement the fourth executive order, which is a very tough order for them. Very tough, and I understand that, and we have a lot of respect for our great pharmaceutical companies, drug companies. We have a lot of respect for them, so we’ll see what they have to say on Tuesday. Maybe they have an idea that’s good, but it’s got to be very substantial. They’re actually in favor of the rebate rule, of the roll back because they say that’s people getting money that aren’t even doing anything for it and bigger money than they’re getting I believe. If they are not, the order will be implemented. If we don’t do a deal or agree to something, the order, number four, favored nations, a big order. They’re all big, all four are very big, by the way, very big. But the fourth order, we’re going to hold that until August 24th, hoping that the pharmaceutical companies will come up with something that will substantially reduce drug prices, and the clock starts right now. So it’s August 24th at 12:00 o’clock, after which the order on favored nations will go into effect and Mark I’ll hold you to it please. 12:00 o’clock not 12:01 right?
Donald Trump: (18:18)
In the meantime, we’re working very hard on therapeutics and a vaccine for the China virus, which remains our top priority and which are coming along at record speed. Thank you very much Dr. Hahn, been fantastic. You really have been fantastic. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month, right? Two. And several more vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks. I did speak to one just recently. They’re working on therapeutics as opposed to vaccine and frankly, that’s the most exciting to me. We can walk into a hospital right now and get people better. I like that even more, but the vaccine long-term will be great.
Donald Trump: (19:05)
So we have them both going. They’re both going rapidly and they’re both going very well and I guess the early indications are beyond happy, right? It’s beyond happy. We’re mass producing all of the most promising candidates already so that on day one … That means that we think we have the answer. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be making that bet. It’s a big bet. So that in day one, the day we get it approved, it will be available immediately. Doctor, is that correct? So if we get it approved … Now, normally this process would take to get up to where we are now three years, four years. I’ve heard numbers like that, and we did it in literally a matter of weeks. It’s a really incredible thing.
Donald Trump: (19:51)
One of the other things, I was talking about drugs in the pipeline for getting drugs approved, and it does cost billions of dollars, and it would be 12 years, 15 years. And under Dr. Hahn and Scott, before you worked very hard, Scott Gottlieb, we’ve got that down to a number that’s less than half and we’re going down further. We have to make sure it’s safe and right to try came out of this whole thing where we have a drug that we think is good. Matt Gates helped with this and getting it approved and Mark, when he was a Congressman, but we had great help from certain people, but right to try is incredible. We have a drug that works, but it’s got to go through this very long and very detailed process for purposes of safety and to make sure it’s good.
Donald Trump: (20:40)
If somebody is terminally ill, very sick, person not going to make it, person very sick, we passed legislation which they’ve been trying to get for 42 years. It’s called right to try where people sign a document that if it doesn’t work out, they’re not suing the drug company, they’re not suing the insurance company and they’re not suing our country. And instead of traveling, if they have money, they travel to Asia and they travel to Europe. They travel all over the world in the hopes of finding a cure, they’re terminally ill. If they have no money, sadly they go home with no hope and they die. We have now a program, right to try, finally happened after, I guess as long as you’ve been a doctor, long before you became a doctor, right? They’ve been trying to get this, but we have a program where they can try these really promising medicines and you have no idea how successful this has already been. It’s incredible.
Donald Trump: (21:41)
And one of the things that really came out of it was the biggest problem for the drug companies. They didn’t want it because they didn’t want it in their sample. Because people that are that sick, they don’t want in the sample. And so we created a separate sample so it doesn’t hurt them. But one of the things that’s come out of it is if it works, what is a better testing formula than that? Some-
Donald Trump: (22:03)
What is a better testing formula than that, somebody that’s terminally ill and all of a sudden makes it? We’re having examples of that. It’s been incredible. It’s been an incredible program. I hope somebody’s going to be able to write a story about it because it’s been one of the things that I’m very proud of it. I love the name even. They have the right to try a drug that’s not going to be available for two years or three years, the terminally ill. Before, you’d say, “Well, the terminally ill. Yeah, but we don’t want to give them a drug that’s going to hurt them.” Well, they going to die. They didn’t want to give them a drug because they thought it might be dangerous. Perhaps, in some cases, it may be dangerous, but we’re having tremendous success with that program. I’m proud of it.
Donald Trump: (22:44)
Additionally, my administration has secured 90% of the world’s supply of the drug, remdesivir, which is having great impact, for the United States and research continues daily on a lot of promising treatments as I said. As we take these historic actions, we’re joined today by Americans who have already benefited from the steps my administration has already taken to reduce the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. We’re going to have a big healthcare bill that we’re going to be putting up very shortly, and it’s going to be very complete.
Donald Trump: (23:20)
Today, what we’re doing on prescription drugs… Again, we’ll have to see what happens on August 25th. We’ll either do the favored nations or not depending on the drug companies, but what we’re putting up in a very short period of time on healthcare will be incredible. We have another one coming on immigration, tremendous bill on immigration. It’ll be, I think, something that nobody thought we would be able to get, so that’ll be great. Paul Madden is a senior citizen who relies on insulin every day. He was paying a fortune, everything, to get it. Paul, if you could… I think Paul’s in the audience. If you could please come up and say a few words about your experience. Thank you, Paul. Thank you very much.
Paul Madden: (24:14)
So you can hear me.
Donald Trump: (24:16)
That’s better.
Paul Madden: (24:18)
Mr. President, thank you so very much for this time to share a few key points supporting your leadership work, reducing the price of insulin, and other diabetes- related medicines used by 34 Americans each day to live healthier fuller lives. As you heard, my name is Paul Madden. I’m a Bostonian. I have lived with insulin-dependent diabetes for 59 years.
Paul Madden: (24:44)
Beginning Medicare, last year, I quickly realized that my ability to afford prescribed insulins that worked best for my health was no longer possible because of their excessive high price. Soaring costs have impacted the quality of my life. Remember that, now, about 34 million people with diabetes. It’s impacted so much I even started to use a 30-year-old insulin to survive, which does not do quite the same great job of balancing my diabetes. Your work, sir, to ensure that insulin is affordable under Medicare will help guarantee that I and millions of seniors who take insulin realize healthier, more productive and dependent, happier lives. Thank you for continuing your commitment to ensure affordability and access for all who use insulin for people with diabetes and so that our children and grandchildren will directly benefit from our improved health. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (25:57)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Paul. That’s great. It’s actually [inaudible 00:26:04] from many, many, many dollars, unaffordable by most people, to pennies, literally pennies a month. I want to thank Seema Verma. You worked so hard on that one. Seema, could you just say something about that? It was the price. Would you come up just for a second, Seema Verma, and just tell them about what we’ve done with respect to very badly-needed insulin.
Seema Verma: (26:34)
Well, the Senior Savings Model that we developed under the president’s leadership is going to reduce the cost of insulin to $35 a month for our seniors. That represents a 66% savings.
Donald Trump: (26:48)
[inaudible 00:26:48].
Seema Verma: (26:48)
I can tell you the vice president and I were traveling in Pennsylvania. We had a gentleman that came up to us, and he showed us his insulin and he said, “You’re going to save me $5,000 a year,” so thank you, President Trump, for your leadership.
Donald Trump: (27:06)
Thank you very much. Great job. That’s a great job. That you. That’s a tremendous difference. We’re also joined by Andrea [Eccles 00:27:19], a dental hygienist from Brunswick, Maryland. Andrea, please come up and say a few words. Thank you. Please.
Andrea Eccles: (27:26)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (27:36)
Thank you very much.
Andrea Eccles: (27:42)
My name is Andrea Eccles, and I am a dental hygienist in Brunswick, Maryland. I was widowed when my husband died in a tragic auto accident and my twin girls were four at the time. He held our family health insurance through his corporate job, and I suddenly found myself having to work full time and put my children in full-time daycare, watch my budget very closely. This is a number of years ago, and at that time, my only choice for healthcare… I work in a very small dental office, and so my only choice for healthcare at that time was what I call the unaffordable care act.
Andrea Eccles: (28:26)
I was paying very high premiums and copays and way too much for prescription drugs. Interestingly, you referenced the EpiPen. I had to purchase that be pins and inhalers. It got to the point actually where I couldn’t even afford to renew the EpiPen. I think I still have a probably 15-year-old EpiPen at my house because they’ve got to be $700. But in my case, this led-
Donald Trump: (28:57)
What did this start at? It’s 700. What did they start-
Andrea Eccles: (29:01)
The original EpiPen, I feel like it was like a $20 copay way back when I first got it, but then as each year… It just kept going up, up to the… But I incidentally ended up with all of these increases in copays and everything over time. I ended up with a over $15,000 medical debt. I’m just a regular person. I don’t have some ridiculously major illnesses or anything.
Andrea Eccles: (29:34)
But during your presidency, President Trump, my premiums have decreased exponentially, and my coverage has increased. My copays have just about disappeared or gone way down, and prescription drugs that I used to budget for myself are at $150 a month is now $15 a month, and because of you, I’m spending hundreds of dollars less a month. This type of savings makes it a really big difference for a single mother such as myself. I just want to thank you so much from the bottom of my-
Donald Trump: (30:11)
[crosstalk 00:30:11].
Andrea Eccles: (30:11)
… heart and for all that you do and for all of your policies that are helping all of us Americans.
Donald Trump: (30:17)
Thank you very [crosstalk 00:30:18].
Andrea Eccles: (30:18)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (30:24)
[inaudible 00:30:24]. That’s really nice. I appreciate it. Some big difference. That’s not a 1% or 2%. That’s big dollars. I want to thank you both very much. Thank you very much. Today’s actions continue my administration’s relentless drive to deliver better healthcare at a lower cost. I signed an executive order to fight kidney disease. That was such a big thing. That was such a beautiful, important thing to do with more transplants and better treatment. People with kidney disease go through hell. They go through hell. Their life is hell. We’ve done a lot, and we’re very proud of it. We’ve really seen some results that are incredible.
Donald Trump: (31:09)
We dramatically expanded the telehealth for all American patients and families in telehealth in this pandemic era have been, it’s increased by, I would say, it was like 1,020%. Incredible. It’s been up at a level that nobody’s ever imagined, and it actually is very good. It’s been something that has come out of the pandemic. One of the only good things that came out of it, frankly, is people are realizing how good that is. It really worked out well.
Donald Trump: (31:44)
We strongly defended Medicare and Social Security, and we’ll always protect and we have been protecting and we’ll always will protect Republicans, totally protect preexisting conditions. Very important. Nothing’s going to happen to your preexisting protections. We ended the gag clause that prevented pharmaceuticals and pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. We had a clause that if you went up to a pharmacist… Is this the correct statement to-
Speaker 1: (32:16)
[crosstalk 00:32:16].
Donald Trump: (32:16)
… and it’s not even believable. You couldn’t talk about price. If the man or woman behind the counter started talking about price, what happens? You take the license away? This is not even believable. Think of that. It prevented pharmacists from telling patients how to buy less expensive drugs. “We have a less expensive drug that’s just as good. I can’t talk about it.” They can’t even say that. I wonder why? Can you imagine these things? We approved a record number of affordable low-cost generics. We’ve increased generics more than any administration by many times, and many of the generics, I would say from what I’m hearing, all of the generic, sometimes people want to see a label, but they say they’re just as good-
Donald Trump: (33:03)
… people want to see a label. But they say they’re just as good as the others except you pay a lot less money. We’ve increased them more than any administration, not even close. And we capped insulin costs that we just discussed for many Medicare recipients, and for a lot of other people at just $35 a month, and it was many times that, as you’ve just heard. Right To Try, I talked about. So proud of it. Nothing matters more to me than the health and wellbeing of the American people. There’s nothing more important to me. With today’s actions, we’re ending decades of sellouts, betrayals, and broken promises from Washington. You’ve had a lot of broken promises. I would say exclusively, broken. You’ve had it. It’s been uniformed, broken promises. We’re putting patients over lobbyists, senior citizens before special interests, and we’re putting America first. I’m putting America first.
Donald Trump: (33:58)
When you look at what we’re doing with Favored Nations on the basis that it kicks in on August 25th. We’ll see. Let’s see what they have to offer. But when you think about it, what are we doing? We’re putting America first. When you hear other countries getting a much better deal on drug prices, there are people that have told me this is more important than healthcare. We’re doing healthcare, but this is more important than anything, the price of drugs. They were getting slaughtered, slaughtered by drug prices. So thank you very much. I want to thank you all for being here. I’d like to ask, if I could, Alex to come up, please, Secretary Azar, to say a few words, and then I’ll sign an Executive Order.
Donald Trump: (34:39)
I’d also like to ask the Governor of Florida. Ron, you’re going to come up and say a few words and we’ll sign up and you’ll go out and buy those drugs and save 50 or 60% for the people of Florida? And other people will be joining you. And that’s great. I want to let you. You will tell me how you do and I’d work on it really fast because now with all of the media back here, you’re under extraordinary pressure, and you never have pressure. One thing I’ll tell you about Ron, Matt will tell you, he handles pressure well. And you’re doing a great job. Thank you very much. Please. Alex.
Secretary Alex Azar: (35:12)
Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for your leadership here. You charged all of us with four goals, ending foreign free riding, improving how our federal programs pay for drugs, lowering out of pockets for our citizens, and getting list prices down. And you did your Drug Pricing Blueprint in May of 2018. Before then, every single year there were massive drug price increases, massive price inflation. Since your Drug Pricing Blueprint, that level of inflation has stopped. And that was an incredible accomplishment. But you said, “That’s not good enough. I want more, even more change for the American people.” And today you’re delivering. Allowing importation. Presidents before you have over and over again to allow the safe importation of drugs from lower cost countries. You’re the first President to deliver on it.
Secretary Alex Azar: (36:07)
You’re going to have Governor DeSantis’ program for States and tribes to import. You’re going to have a personal importation program where individuals can get their drugs low costs from abroad. And you’re going to have an insulin re-importation program so Americans can get their insulin re-imported from Canada at lower prices. You’re taking on the federal health centers. You’re taking on the issue that they are getting radical discounts on insulin and epi-pens and you’re going to make sure low income Americans get the benefit of those discounts. And you’re taking on the middlemen. $30 billion a year of concealed kickbacks to middlemen are going to now flow to Medicare patients when they show up at the pharmacy, an average of 30% discounts at out-of-pockets when they show up at a pharmacy thanks to the President’s bold action.
Secretary Alex Azar: (36:52)
And we’re going to end foreign free riding, taking on foreign socialist systems that have been living off of American seniors’ investments by overpaying in drug prices, and now they’re going to have to bear their fair share. I’ve got to tell you, what you’ve done and what you’re doing today, you’ve done more than any President in American history to take on drug prices. You’re taking on the drug companies, you’re taking on the middlemen, you’re taking on the European socialists, all for the forgotten men and women of America who show up at a pharmacy counter. And for that, I am so proud of what you were doing today. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (37:37)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Alex. Please, Ron, please.
Governor Ron DeSantis: (37:53)
Well, Mr. President, thanks for your leadership on this. When we started the legislative session in Florida in 2019, our Speaker of the House, Jose Oliva, was here with me. He had a big healthcare agenda. So we did some phenomenal things like expand telehealth, repeal certificate of need laws. But he really wanted to do something big on prescription drugs. I did too, because it’s obviously an issue. But I told Jose, I said, “Listen, we’ve got to find a way where we will actually be able to accomplish something. I don’t want to just throw a flare up there and then virtue signal that we’re doing something about drugs and then nothing works.” And so there was a provision of law which required the federal government’s approval. So we had a plan in Florida. We moved forward. I went to see you.
Governor Ron DeSantis: (38:36)
And this law has been on the books for at least almost 20 years, so other Presidents have had the ability to pull this lever and they didn’t do it. And I went up and asked you, and not everyone was in favor of you doing it. You had a lot of people saying, “Don’t do it.” But you were laser focused on lowering drug prices for people, particularly our seniors in the State of Florida, and that was abundantly clear. And so when Florida then moved forward, we knew we had your support. We knew that this day would eventually come. And I think that the fact that we’re standing here today, obviously, Florida, we did some groundwork, but really it’s a result of Presidential leadership. The people of Florida want to thank you for siding with us on this.
Governor Ron DeSantis: (39:20)
Like I said, this could have been done for almost 20 years and it hasn’t been done. You’re the one that got it done. So, Mr. President, thank you.
Donald Trump: (39:27)
Thank you very much, Ron. Thank you. Thank you. So we’re going to sign four very important documents. I just want to thank Amy. And congratulations, Amy, to you. That elevation is a big one. And you’re going to do fantastically. Russell, congratulations. He just got confirmed and we appreciate it. Fantastic job. And Pat, thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you very much. Okay, let’s go. Access to affordable [inaudible 00:40:30]. Thank you, all. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (40:33)
[inaudible 00:07:44].
Donald Trump: (40:42)
Thank you very much. Number two, Increase In Drug Importation. That’s great. Let Ron have that. Where’s Ron?
Governor Ron DeSantis: (41:23)
I’m right here.
Donald Trump: (41:24)
Come on, Ron. Get up here, Ron. It’s yours because that’s what you have to do, right? Importation. Lowering Prices For Patients By Eliminating Kickbacks.
Speaker 2: (41:40)
Yes! Woo!
Donald Trump: (41:40)
This will go into effect on August 25th if we don’t make a deal, right? Favored Nations. Thank you all very much.
Governor Ron DeSantis: (42:40)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 3: (42:40)
[inaudible 00:42:24].
Donald Trump: (42:40)
Thank you again, Matt. Thank you, all.
Speaker 3: (42:40)
I would love one.
Speaker 4: (42:40)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (42:40)
You got a good deal, huh? Thank you all very much.
Speaker 5: (42:55)
Thank you, sir.
Speaker 6: (42:55)
Thank, you, sir.
Donald Trump: (42:55)
Thank you all very much. Thank you.
Speaker 7: (42:55)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (42:56)
Good luck."
"Jul 24, 2020","President Donald J. Trump: (00:15)
Thank you, very much. Please, let’s enjoy ourselves. This is a tremendous moment for Jim and your family. And let’s just enjoy ourselves for a little while. We’ll ask Jim to say a few words. I want to hear what he has to say about his great talent, his great running ability. I find athletics to be extraordinary. I love it. Thank you for being here. And today it is my privilege to present our nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom to a legendary athlete and a legendary runner, Olympian and true American Patriot, former Congressman Jim Ryun. Jim, congratulations. Fantastic.
Jim Ryun: (00:59)
Thank you very much.
President Donald J. Trump: (01:03)
We’re joined today by Jim’s wife, Anne. Thank you Anne, very much. Congratulations.
Anne Ryun: (01:08)
Thank you.
President Donald J. Trump: (01:09)
And various family members. But his son, where’s Ned? Ned, thank you very much. Catharine, thank you very much. And I’m going to ask you to come up and say a few words, the both of you, so you better be prepared. You’ve got a lot of news back there. See, I’m being nice today. I don’t use the other word in front of the word news. But Jim’s journey started with a prayer. After being cut from his church baseball team, I can’t believe that, that must’ve been a bad day, huh, and his junior high basketball team, they probably made a mistake, he asked God for guidance. Jim wanted to know God’s plan for him. And he only had one request, that it was something to do with sports. You liked sports.
President Donald J. Trump: (01:53)
That prayer was answered when Jim joined the high school track team. He joined it and had no experience whatsoever, as he said, he didn’t really know what he was doing and he didn’t know what he was doing there. In his very first mile race, however, he came in second place to the reigning state champion and a real talented person. Do you ever see him around by the way? He’s still around?
Jim Ryun: (02:17)
Yes, he is.
President Donald J. Trump: (02:18)
Okay, that’s pretty good. He’s still saying, “What happened?” But Jim’s first time in running the mile was four minutes and 32.4 seconds. So that tells you there’s something genetically that’s pretty good, because that doesn’t happen. Four minutes, 32.4 seconds, first time he ever ran the mile. That was the last time he ever came in second in a high school race. And after that, Jim was always first. The next year, Jim ran a 3.59 mile and became the first high school athlete in history to smash the four minute barrier. That summer he also competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as the youngest middle distance runner in the world, by quite a bit actually. In Jim’s senior year of high school, he ran against three time Olympic gold medal winner Pete Snell. He was good wasn’t he?
President Donald J. Trump: (03:09)
But that was a bad day for Pete. Before the event, Snell reportedly said that he didn’t think Jim would really have much of a chance or be much of a factor. Jim soon proved him wrong. With 300 meters left in the race, Jim surged ahead of the pack and swept across the finish line in a fraction of his time. What was your time? Three minutes and 55.3 seconds. That’s not bad, right?
Jim Ryun: (03:36)
It was okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (03:37)
Not bad? I don’t know. What did Pete say? Was he gracious about it?
Jim Ryun: (03:41)
Very gracious.
President Donald J. Trump: (03:43)
But he was a great runner. I mean, he was a great runner. This also right now stands in high school as a record 35 years. It took 35 years to break that record. When ESPN ranked the greatest high school athletes, listen to this, this is incredible, when ESPN ranked the greatest high school athletes of all time, all sports, they listed Jim Ryun as number one. That’s not bad for guy who couldn’t make his baseball team, right? That’s really an amazing achievement. That’s incredible. Jim continued his extraordinary athletic career at the University of Kansas. In 1966, he set his first world record in the mile at a time of three minutes and 51.3 seconds, becoming the first American to do so in more than three decades.
President Donald J. Trump: (04:39)
After the race, a young fan ran up to him and asked for his autograph. That fan would soon become his future wife. That was a good autograph. That was Anne. You two are so lucky that happened. I wonder where you’d be, I guess. That’s fantastic. Great, Anne. In 1967, Jim ran an incredible 3.511 mile, which would stand as the world record mile for almost a decade. Jim still describes it as the easiest race he ever ran. Is that right? It was magic.
Jim Ryun: (05:18)
Amazing.
President Donald J. Trump: (05:19)
It was magic. To this day, it’s the last time in American set the world record in the mile. So that was a while ago. What is the world record right now? So your at 3.51.
Jim Ryun: (05:32)
3.43.
President Donald J. Trump: (05:32)
3.43 or so? Okay, that’s a long time. Training and lots of other things.
Jim Ryun: (05:43)
Yeah, some of the other things aren’t so good.
President Donald J. Trump: (05:43)
We have breaking news now. This could be the big story today. That’s great. But that is some long period of time that he held the record. In 1968, Jim Bradley represented Team USA at the Mexico City Olympics and won the silver medal for the 1500 and he competed in 1972 at the Munich Olympics with great distinction. A few years later, Jim retired from running. He had been on the cover of Sports Illustrated seven times, was ranked Sportsman of the Year in 1966, was inducted into the Kansas Sports Hall of Fame and received the immortal nickname Master of the Mile. And he was, I remember it. I shouldn’t tell you that, but I remember a lot of your races. They weren’t even close, actually. In 1975, you founded the Jim Ryun Running Camps. For the past 45 years, Jim has helped teach thousands of young people to reach their fullest and best athletic potential. He has been a dedicated mentor to campers and shared in the critical importance of a Christian faith. He is very devoted to Christianity.
President Donald J. Trump: (06:52)
In 1996, Jim was elected to the House of Representatives and he went on to serve five terms in Congress. I wish we had him now. We have some great people in there though, I’ll tell you. We have some great, dedicated, hard workers and they’ve done a terrific job, right? Wouldn’t you say, Ned? I think so. Some really great ones. But he served five terms from Kansas’s Second District. He was a principled, committed, very tough and beloved lawmaker. That’s what they said. He was tough and yet beloved. That’s a rare combination. Jim has personified the greatness of our country throughout his life, whether he was running on a track race or whether he was doing anything there was, running an office or running for office. He was always the top person. People respected him more. I’ve heard it for a long time. I’d ask about him and they’d say, “When he was in Washington, he was just a respected person.”
President Donald J. Trump: (07:47)
He was a giant of American athletics, a dedicated public servant and a man of charity, generosity, and faith. He’s a great man, actually. Jim, thank you so much for your unfailing devotion to our country and congratulations on a lifetime of incredible success. Not only athletically, that was obviously a big deal, but what you’ve done in life and even with your family has been just incredible. So I’d like to congratulate you very much. And before we present you with the incredible beautiful metal, I’d like to ask maybe Catharine and Ned to come up and say a few words, if you’d like, and talk about your father. Please.
Catharine Ryun: (08:30)
Well, thank you, first of all, for giving us a couple of minutes. Dad, thank you for being the man that you are. I know that today it’s all about your accolades in the public eye, but you have been such an amazing dad and wife of more than 50 years to mom, and just a man of character. And this is a man who loves the Lord with all his heart and has been such an amazing father to all of us. And so thank you and proud to your daughter. And Mr. President, thank you for having us here today. I want to leave you with my favorite verses from Numbers. It’s, “May the Lord bless you and keep you. May he make his face to shine upon you and give you peace.”
President Donald J. Trump: (09:06)
Thank you very much. That’s so nice. Thank you, Catharine.
Ned Ryun: (09:12)
Mr. President, thank you. This means a great deal to me. I’m not going to get choked up. I got choked up last night when I was talking and I told myself I would not do that again. But I just wanted to tell everybody, you know my dad as the miler, as the Master of the Mile, as the world record holders, the three time Olympian. And I want to tell a story really quick of one of his former colleagues, Jay Dickey, out of Arkansas. And he pulled me aside one day and he said, “Ned, there are a lot of people in Congress who think they’re all that. They’re drunk on power. They’re arrogant.” He was like, “Your dad walks the halls as one of the most humble, gracious people I know. But the thing about your dad is there are very few people in the world that can say they were ever the very, very best at what they did in all of the world.
Ned Ryun: (09:56)
“In a world full of billions of people, you are the absolute best at what you did, and your dad was. But you would never know that because he’s so gracious, he’s so kind, and he’s so humble.” And I tell people this all the time, the sacrifice, everything that went in to being the very best in the world, and yet you would never know it. You could have a conversation with my dad and when he talks with his fans and he gives him autographs and he shares a few moments with them, the graciousness that is displayed as an example to me as a song. And I tell people this all the time, the integrity and the honesty, the nobility that he has shown in life, if I can be half the man that he is, it’ll be a triumph. Thank you.
Jim Ryun: (10:58)
Mr. President. I learned a long time ago, when you have such a great introduction, thank you for the comments, and you have your children and saying wonderful things it’s probably a good idea to find the exit while you’re ahead, and I am considering that. However, I want to make a few remarks. Mr. President, thank you. On the behalf of my family, which includes my wife at 51 years, and yes, she did chase me down, my children and grandchildren, our dear friends who have traveled far and wide, thank you for bestowing on me this high honor with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On behalf of them, I accept that and I thank you for this privilege. These achievements we are celebrating began with a simple prayer. You actually talked about that a moment ago.
Jim Ryun: (11:39)
After being cut from the church baseball team, junior high basketball team, and, well, I never made the junior high track team, I began ending each day with this simple prayer, and by the way, I would throw it out there for you that if you’re looking for something, this would be a good way to start. Dear God, I’d like my life to amount to something. I believe you have a plan for my life. I’d appreciate your help in figuring it out. And if you could help me out and make a plan that would include sports of some kind, I’d really appreciate it. Thank you and good night. God did indeed show up in a huge way answering my simple heartfelt prayer. I finally made my first athletic team, the Wichita East Cross Country Team my sophomore year in high school. God gave me a former Marine, Bob Timmons, to coach me.
Jim Ryun: (12:26)
I wasn’t even supposed to be at East High School. Southeast High was just down the street from where I live, but as I didn’t have plans to go to college I instead went across town to East High School to go to a vo-tech school to be a draftsman so I could follow my father and brother and work at Boyne. But as we know, God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform, and in my first year of running, I became the National High School Record holder. 18 months after starting to run seriously in 1964, I became the first high school boy to run a mile in four minutes, a feat which many had thought impossible until coach Timmons, who we affectionately called Timmy, had me sit with him on a bus ride from Kansas city back to Wichita my sophomore year. He told me, “Jim, I think you can be the first high schooler to break four minutes.” Being perfectly honest, I thought at the time he might be just a little crazy.
Jim Ryun: (13:20)
Every reality begins with a dream, a seed of inspiration, and Timmy planted a seed and I wanted to believe him that maybe, just maybe, it was possible. I committed to it, took ownership, and in the blazing hot summer days and in the bitter cold winters of Kansas began running 100 miles a week, week after week, month after month, many of them run in the dark after school, all to compress those countless hours and thousands of miles into running for laps in less than four minutes. Not only would I break the four minute mile my junior year in high school, several months later, I would find myself pouring every ounce of strength down the home stretch of the 1964 Olympic trials, making the Olympic team at 1500 meters, winning by mere feet at the age of 17. It was the beginning of an amazing eight years. I would set the American record in the mile at 18 and would follow Timmy to the University of Kansas wearing the famous pink and blue colors, winning NCAA titles.
Jim Ryun: (14:20)
I can still hear our beloved Pat-Pat Timmins cheering me on even today. Pat-Pat Timmins and Timmy would become godparents to our children and never become … Let me try that again. They were grandparents to our children and Ned would be the godfather, son of our daughter. I’ll get that out. Let’s try that one more time. Godparents to our son Ned. I would make two more Olympic teams, the world record in the mile multiple times, the world record in the 1500, the world record in the half mile, the indoor world record in the mile and half mile, the American record in two miles, and helped set numerous world records on various relay teams. And that’s after being cut from the church baseball team.
Jim Ryun: (15:06)
This boy from Wichita, Kansas who would one day have written his name on a piece of wood and buried it and hopes that someday someone might find it and remember him would make covers of Sports Illustrated seven times, all of that before the age of 25. In a day and age, when many think it’s appropriate to dishonor our flag, I will tell you, it is one of the greatest honors and privileges of my life to represent this amazing country and to wear the stars and stripes on my chest while racing in the ’60s and ’70s. There was such pride and love of country, and I cannot tell you, Mr. President, how much I appreciate your full throated championing of this great country.
Jim Ryun: (15:53)
The accolades in my life have exceeded anything I could have imagined. And now Mr. President, with the Medal of Freedom bestowed on me by truly one of the greatest Republican Presidents is such a great honor. Mr. President, you have big dreams for America, ones that echo for me my old coach. Instill a dream what could be and then pursuit it with everything you have. Your dream of keeping America and the American Republic great and then making her greater is an epic and noble pursuit. My wife, Anne, our daughter, Catharine, my son, Ned and Becca, and our four grandchildren along with our dear friends present today, join you in the pursuit of helping make this a reality. Mr. President, it may surprise you, time diminishes us all. I no longer run four minute miles. In fact, I’m not sure I could run a four minute half mile.
Jim Ryun: (16:42)
And while the applause and cheers of men fade, nothing can take away from me those moments when I was young and full flight down the final back stretch, the wind in my face, wings on my feet, powering away from my opponents, there was a period in those times when my mind overcame a tired body and for those few glorious moments I would slip the bonds of the physical and I was free, I had won. And I look back now realizing my running career was a celebration and there is no doubt in my mind that we were all made for a purpose. I was made to run. I was also made to glorify God in all that I do. So, on my words and in my actions, I celebrate that purpose and will do that always to his glory.
Jim Ryun: (17:26)
What Anne and I cherish very much as having had the privilege of raising four beautiful children who contribute to our nation daily. In addition, we’ve been blessed with the opportunity to give back to the sport of running through the Jim Ryun Running Camps. We’ve had thousands of young runners attend the camp through the years, instilling in them this truth, God loves you and has a plan for your life. And then we challenge them with the work to become human beings, to become physically, mentally, and spiritually fit. As I receive this medal, and its an incredible honor, thank you, Mr. President, I will close by saying this. To God be the glory, great things he has done. This day, my life, and all of these achievements, this is the Lord’s doing and it’s marvelous in his eyes.
Jim Ryun: (18:07)
Mr. President, thank you for your loving and serving this great Republican country. May God continue to bless you and your family with his peace. Thank you again for this great honor.
President Donald J. Trump: (18:18)
Thank you very much.
Jim Ryun: (18:33)
You’re very welcome.
President Donald J. Trump: (18:33)
Congratulations.
Speaker 6: (18:51)
Jim Ryun is a world class athlete and a highly respected former member of Congress. As one of the best middle distance runners of all time, he is the last American to hold the world record in the mile run. He proudly represented the United States at the 1968 Summer Olympics, earning a silver medal in the 1500 meter race. Following his success on the track, Mr. Ryun channeled his patriotism into a noble career in public service, representing the Second Congressional District of Kansas for more than a decade, distinguishing himself as a principled Conservative. The United States probably recognizes Jim Ryun for his meritorious contributions to our nation.
Jim Ryun: (19:23)
Thank you. It’s a great honor. You’ve done a great job. Keep it up.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:23)
Thank you, everyone. Thank you."
"Jul 23, 2020","President Donald J. Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We’ve had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus. I’ve reminded people of the importance of masks when you can’t socially distance, in particular. A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places. Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents. We’re working very hard on that. We’re doing very well all over the country, and also about contracting with Pfizer. We made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer. We think they’re very close, but we have a lot of companies that are very close to produce a vaccine. And I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:01)
This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida. It’s a place I love and I love that state. The drawings look absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good so fast with everything going on. And everything was going well. A tremendous list of speakers, thousands of people wanting to be there, and I mean, in some cases desperately be there. They wanted to attend. People making travel arrangements all over the country. They wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line. But I looked at my team and I said, “The timing for this event is not right. It’s just not right with what’s happened recently, the flare up in Florida, to have a big convention. It’s not the right time.” It’s really something that, for me, I have to protect the American-
President Donald J. Trump: (12:03)
… really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. That’s what I’ve always done. That’s what I always will do. That’s what I’m about. They said, “Sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm, incredible enthusiasm.” Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they’ve seen. We can do this safely and we can do it responsibly. I said, there’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that’s from the China virus or the radical left mob that you see in Portland, where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days they went in. People were out of control for 51 days, long time, and Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in and they’ve done a great job in protecting our property, federal courthouse and other property.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:01)
And most importantly, protecting our people. Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit. A lot of other cities where so many people are shot and so many people are killed. People elected me to help and to protect. So I told my team it’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention. We’ll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday as has always been planned. We were never taking that off. That’s remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That’s where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina and they’ll be doing the nomination.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:47)
We’re going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online the week that we’re discussing, which will be really good. I think we’re going to do it well. I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won’t do a big crowded convention per se. It’s just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country and even in the world who would be coming into the state, and I don’t want to do anything to upset it. They’ll be doing very well very shortly. We’re going to put some maps up of the country behind me. You’ll see that the area that we’re talking about is a hotspot. You’ll also see a lot of the country has no problem whatsoever, most of the country actually.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:38)
So I’m always going to take care of you so that that’s the way we’re going to do it. I’ve spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and it’s great merries. Really great guy. They wanted it so badly, and all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida. Just very special people, a very special group, and they were there for us 100%.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:12)
Today I want to provide an update on the actions we’re taking to support the safe reopening of America schools. Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they’re essential to our children’s future. Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high risk factors can continue to participate from home. Very important. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:51)
It said, “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in a social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical and sexual abuse, substance abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. This in turn places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and of some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there’s been a substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and for families.” So that’s very important and there’s a… either way, it goes both ways.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:46)
The National Education Association recently stated despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support. Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important. One study estimates that due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35% behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50% behind in math. That’s a big statement. According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low income Black and Hispanic students. They’re the ones that are hit the hardest. We don’t want that happening.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:35)
30 million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals. Over 70% of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools. According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly having to do with child abuse. They have neglect, and these neglected cases are submitted by education personnel. So, people in the education world on the premises will be the ones that report neglect and other problems. When they see the children, they know if they’ve been neglected. They know if they’ve been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it’s at home or someplace else, but they see this at school. You don’t get to see that if you’re not going to school. It’s a big thing.
President Donald J. Trump: (18:26)
Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus. Very substantially. When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. 99% of all China virus hospitalizations are adults and 99.96% of all fatalities are adults. That means that children are a tiny percentage, less than 1%, and even a small percentage of 1%. In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States that have been lost thus far to the coronavirus. Many different names. Many, many different names. The life of every child is sacred and must be protected. Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America’s children.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:34)
I have a very, very special person who loves children who’s I think one of the greatest athletes of all time. A lot of people say the greatest pitcher of all time, known as the relief pitcher. Could have been whatever he wanted. To some people, he is the greatest reliever of all time by far, substantially more saves than anybody else. In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently, and he… I’m reading off these stats. I knew he was the best, I knew he was great, but I didn’t know it was almost double anybody else.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:07)
But he’s a man who loves children. Has children, loves children, works hard with children. We’re going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera. He’s the Sandman, right? My wife said, “Darling, why do they call him the Sandman?” I said, “They play the song. He just puts the batteries to sleep.” And that’s exactly what happen. So, having Mariano here is a great honor. Thank you very much. I was talking about children and schools, and there’s nobody that’s done more than you have. Thank you very much, Mariano. Fantastic man.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:42)
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers and to protect students. So we do have to protect the teachers and the families also. We have to remember that all families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at higher risk.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:15)
In cities or states that are current hotspots, and you’ll see that in the map behind me, districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks. That’s possible. That’ll be up to governors. The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community. But every district should be actively making preparations to open. Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system. Maybe even as strong as yours. They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem. So, it’s pretty amazing actually. Great, great credit.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:57)
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide. As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk, much lower the case of young children, to resume work at school as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing. We want that. A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms. We don’t want to do that. At the same time, we have to get our economy going. We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday. Housing prices, pricing of housing up 21%, the highest in history. It’s the highest number in history. Real estate housing went up 21%.
President Donald J. Trump: (22:55)
Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely. I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions. This isn’t about politics. It’s about something very, very important. This is not about politics. I even think it’s bad politics if you do the wrong decision, very bad politics. We’re asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next Coronavirus Relief bill. This funding will support mitigation measures such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aids, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing and crucially, mask wearing. This money is an addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year. That money we have, some is distributed and some is not distributed. If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public…
President Donald J. Trump: (24:03)
The funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice. The key word being choice. If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions. So we’d like the money to go to the parents of the student, this way they can make the decision that’s best for them. We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school, harming their mental, physical, and emotional development. Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families. The Council of economic advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year. It’s a tremendous problem. It’s a tremendous problem. Schools have to open safely, but they have to open. More than a dozen European countries, as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others have already reopened schools and cases have not risen. We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.
President Donald J. Trump: (25:20)
We’ll continue to support states and cities and the current hot spots in the south, southwest and west. The governors, I know them all. They’re all very, very capable. They’re doing a very good job. They’re working so hard. You wouldn’t even believe it. We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance. We’re helping with doctors and nurses, medical personnel of all kinds. As a PPE update, we’re in close communication with governors and states. We have supplies, everything they could possibly need. We’re very strong on supplies. You remember I used to say the cupboards were bare? Well, now the cupboards are the opposite. Due to our historic efforts to increase both the national stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days worth of supplies on hand.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:13)
And most importantly, they have ventilators because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past. Now we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them in many cases to other countries. For states that are making requests, we’re rapidly delivering. In the last 24 hours, FEMA has the deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000, well, let me change that. We’ve created about 600,000 different supplies. We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington. I think the number is 600. We’re going to check that and we’ll give it to you in a little while, but we’ve got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators. I think we’ve sent out about 600 just recently.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:12)
The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world by far. Roughly half of the tests, or either the rapid point of care tests, which frankly solves a lot of problem and delay, five to 15 minutes instead of waiting for service both ways in both directions and then at the lab. But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are five to 15 minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day, some cases immediately.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:50)
We’re continuing to surge testing to current hot spots such as Miami and Phoenix to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further. There’s a copy of the map and you have it right behind me. That’s really very much indicating where the problems are. You see from that it’s in great shape, lots of it. The northeast has become very clean. The country is in very good shape, other than if you look south and west, some problems. That’ll all work out. On therapies, we’ve worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of Remdesivir are arriving this week. It’s a lot. That’s a lot. They’re working around the clock to make it a tremendous impact. We’ve also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks. Arizona is doing very well. It’s heading down. Numbers are heading down. I think very quickly. Governor’s done a great job. They’ve all done a great job. They’ve all done a great job. Working hard.
President Donald J. Trump: (29:03)
We’ll continue to monitor the areas rising and with respect to cases, and we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation, this horrible disease that was sent to us by China. It should not have been sent. They should have stopped it. They could’ve stopped it. They didn’t. And the entire world has gotten infected and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now. This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they’re going through a very hard time with this in Moscow in particular. I spoke to the Crown Prince Saudi Arabia. They’re doing well, but they’re going through a lot. Everybody’s going through a lot. Yesterday I spoke to the heads of four different countries. All four are going through a lot, going through a hard time. This could have been stopped. It could have been stopped quickly and easily, but for some reason it wasn’t, and we’ll figure out what that reason was. So with that, if you have any questions, please.
Steve: (30:15)
On the convention, were you simply not convinced that you could keep people safe at the convention?
President Donald J. Trump: (30:17)
I just felt it was wrong, Steve, to have people going to what turned out to be a hot spot. You know, when we chose it, it was not at all hot. It was free. And all of a sudden it happened quickly. It happens quickly and it goes away and it goes away quickly. The key is we wanted to go away without a lot of death, without a lot of problems. And we’re learning so much about the disease. That’s why we’re very cognizant of nursing homes. We’re watching them very carefully, and people over a certain age, and especially people over a certain age with diabetes or heart disease in particular, but with a problem. So we didn’t want to take any chances. So we had a lot of people. The delegates want to be there.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:59)
We’re going to do a fairly reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina. The nomination will be produced. And then we’ll announce what we’re doing, how we’re doing it, whether it’s something that’s done online, I guess, you could call it online. So there could be nothing like our last convention, unfortunately. That was a great convention in a great place, as you know. We had a great time, great time in Cleveland, but it’s a different world, and it will be for a little while. We want to get the world back to what it was. And I think we’ll have that including great job numbers, including so many things that are happening so positive. I have to say the stock market is close to records. For NASDAQ, it is a record. That’s already exceeded its highest numbers, but we want to get our country back to what it was.
Steve: (31:58)
So will your acceptance speech be from the White House and are you worried that-
President Donald J. Trump: (31:58)
We haven’t set that yet, Steve. We’ll probably announce that over the next few days.
Steve: (32:05)
Are you worried this might dampen enthusiasm for you?
President Donald J. Trump: (32:05)
Look, we’ve done a great job. We built the greatest economy in the world. Nobody close, not China, not anybody. We had to close it. We saved millions of lives and we opened it. But we had the best numbers in history for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, every group you want to name, young people without a diploma, young people with a high school diploma, with a college diploma, anything you want to name, we had the best numbers. Women doing incredibly. Never been a time like that. And we had to turn it off because of what China did. We had to turn it off. And then all of a sudden, now we turn it back on and we’re doing very well, but it was very bad.
President Donald J. Trump: (32:50)
China, speaking about China, the trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it. When I made it was a great deal, but they’re setting records. Yesterday was a record corn day. They purchased more corn than any order ever. And that went on for two or three days, and soybeans and all. But it just means much less to me. Can you understand that? It just means much less to me. Please. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (33:19)
Thank you. What was the one thing, if there was one thing, that changed your mind about the convention and did Florida officials ask you to cancel it?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:23)
No, they didn’t. We’re dealing with them, but they didn’t. I would just say safety, just safety. I could see the media saying, “Oh, this is very unsafe.” I don’t want to be in that position. It’s safety. Not because of the media, but that’s what they would say, and we’ll have a very nice something. We’ll figure it out. It’ll be online in some form. Maybe it’ll be something even a little bit different. We have time. We’re talking about the end of August, but I think it’ll be something that will be exciting, but there can be nothing like having 25,000 people. We had a tremendous thing planned, a tremendous convention planned in North Carolina. And it would have been very good, but a much smaller version in Florida. But then we saw what was happening pretty quickly. We saw that the virus was coming up that coast. So.
Steve: (34:16)
Do you think it’s an ackowledgement of the severity of the situation in Florida?
President Donald J. Trump: (34:20)
No, I think it’s going to come and go. It will. I mean, you take a look at some of these locations were heavily infected, I mean, to a point where Deborah and I were talking that when you look at what happened in New York and what happened in New Jersey and other places, and now you’re looking and it’s gone. Hope it stays gone. I think it will. But we have to be vigilant. We have to be careful. And we also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important. It’s hard for us to say we’re going to have a lot of people packed in a room and then other people shouldn’t do it.
President Donald J. Trump: (34:58)
Don’t forget, we’re talking about schools and we want them to be vigilant. And we’re saying open, and then we’re saying here, you have a big room, but I also, if you notice, I said, where bars are crowded, where other things are crowded. Well, there’s nothing more crowded than a convention. A convention, I mean, you’ve seen them. And even though you try and keep people away from each other, it’s just not that kind of a thing. They probably can’t do that. It just doesn’t work for them. So I think we’re setting an example by doing it. It’s very important. Yeah, John.
John: (35:27)
Mr. President, if I could come back to school openings. You talked about money that Congress is looking at to help schools who want to reopen. If school wants to reopen, but is concerned about testing, would you consider directing some of that money toward testing for either a school district or even individual schools if that’s what it took to open the school?
President Donald J. Trump: (35:47)
Yeah, I think so. I mean, a lot of people feel differently about testing. We talk about it a lot. When we have 50 million tests plus, and we broke the 50 million tests mark. Second in the world is India, which has 1.4-
President Donald J. Trump: (36:03)
… second in the world is India, which has 1.4 billion people, and they had 12 million tests. And other countries that are very big, had 2 million tests. And some countries, essentially only test if you’re sick and walk into a hospital, or walk into a doctor’s office, or you’re literally really sick, they essentially don’t do tests unless you’re sick. And I understand that too. So, if they feel that that’s what they want, it’s… That would be fine.
John: (36:29)
You would tell Congress… You would encourage Congress to pay for testing [crosstalk 00:00:32]?
President Donald J. Trump: (36:33)
I would, if they want. Again, we’ve done 50 million tests, there’s nobody even close in the whole world. You look at our mortality rate, you look at our death rate, you look at different statistics, we’re doing very well. But, one death is too many. This should never have happened, this should never have been allowed to happen from China.
John: (36:51)
Also, Mitch McConnell’s office just put out a statement a moment ago about the Phase 4 relief package, CARES 2, saying, “It’s tailored precisely for this phase of the crisis.” Yet it does not include your payroll tax cut. So, do you believe it’s perfectly balanced?
President Donald J. Trump: (37:06)
Yeah, I’d like to see a payroll tax cut, I think is great for the workers. The Democrats would never have gone for it. They don’t want it. They’re not big into the workers, I guess. And based on that, I told them last night, I told the Republicans who have been working very hard on this, I’ll tell you, and they want what’s right for the country. And hopefully, the Democrats ultimately will. But I said, “I think a payroll tax would be good.” But you’re not going to get it from the Democrats, we need their votes as you know. It’s not like… We have a majority, but it’s not enough that we… That’s why, I guess, we have an election coming up. So, you still need Democrat votes, and we’re not going to get the Democrat votes on that. So I’d like to see it, I think it would be very good for the workers. But, if we’re not going to get their votes, I guess we have to go onto the next thing. A payroll tax cut would have been very good. And maybe something happens. Yes, please.
Speaker 2: (37:53)
You talk about setting an example on Jacksonville, but I just wonder if some people are going to take away from this the lesson that you’re pushing too far, too fast. It seemed for a while the numbers were going up in Jacksonville and we were going to have a problem there. This comes up at a time you’re pushing for schools to reopen, we have the opening of the Major League Baseball season. Isn’t the example of Jacksonville that we’re pushing too fast?
President Donald J. Trump: (38:17)
Well, baseball, as an example, we were discussing a little while ago, you’re going to be at an empty stadium. I’ve agreed… Randy Levine is a great friend of mine from the Yankees, he asked me to throw out the first pitch. And I think I’m doing that on August 15th, at Yankee Stadium. And I say, “How’s the crowd going to be?” And it’s like you don’t have a crowd, there is no such thing. It’s going to be interesting, Mariano. He’s not used to that. I’ve been at many games, he walks in the place goes crazy. I think it’d be just as good without the crowd, you were just born with it, some people are born with it. I don’t know, this is only for the baseball players, but I’ve never seen a pitcher throw a ball where so many bats were broken as Mariano’s, he’s got the all- time record. I said, “How do you do that?” He said, “Great parents.” When you get right down to it, right? How do you do that? It’s called, parents. But-
Speaker 2: (39:08)
[crosstalk 00:03:07].
President Donald J. Trump: (39:09)
Yeah, just to finish. I think that we have to all set examples. I think Major League Baseball is setting an example by playing to empty stadiums and so are other sports, you see that. Now… Then they’ll allow a certain number in. I see golf is now… Soon will be allowing people to come in, in percentages. And all of a sudden, we want to get back to normal. The key is to get back to normal because nobody wants to see this. But, I think it’s really good that baseball is opening, it looks like football is opening, it looks like sports are opening. We have… it’s a tremendous thing, psychologically, for our country. And we’re all [inaudible 00:03:47]… We’re going to see, right now, some beautiful, young, Little Leaguers outside, with a great future ahead of them. They were already practicing on the front lawn of the White House. And we’re going to go out and say hello to them, and it’ll be really great. How about one more? Please, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (40:05)
President Trump, the Washington Post earlier today reported that one thing holding up the GOP coronavirus bill is the White House asking that it include language regarding the FBI building in downtown Washington, D.C., is that true?
President Donald J. Trump: (40:19)
I don’t know that they’re putting it in this bill. But, I know they want to have a new FBI building. This one is very old and it’s really… It was never built to a very high standard, as you probably have heard. And is got a lot of danger involved, and panels falling off the outside, and pieces of concrete falling off the building. And they want to build it at the site that they have it. They had options very far away from Washington. And I said to them, frankly, you have to be near the Justice Department. There’s nothing better than the site, the site they have now is better. But they were looking at sites in Maryland, and Virginia, and different places, but they would have been too far away. So, I have been encouraging them to build it. And if you’re going to… You have a choice. You can renovate the existing building, but it’s not a good building.
President Donald J. Trump: (41:03)
Or, you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for a hundred years, and have it be incredible, even with tracks on top, they’re talking about. We have… Because, FBI people like to work out a lot. And you could have, literally, quarter mile tracks on top. It’s a very big site, very wide site. So, I think the idea… The best idea would be to build a new building and that way you have it for a long time. Renovation can never be as good as a new building, in that case. I know they’re talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else, but the FBI needs a new building and we’ll get it done. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much."
"Jul 22, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:04)
Today, my administration reached a historic agreement with Pfizer to produce and deliver 100 million doses of their vaccine immediately following its approval. Hopefully, the approval process will go very quickly and we think we have a winner there. We also think we have other companies right behind that are doing very well in the vaccines, long ahead of schedule. As part of Operation Warp Speed, this agreement will also ensure that we receive an additional 500 million doses shortly thereafter.
President Donald Trump: (00:37)
This is another crucial step in our effort to develop, manufacturer and distribute a vaccine in record-breaking time. Really a very small fraction of the time based on previous schedules. I want to thank the FDA. I want to thank everybody involved. It’s been an incredible process. As discussed yesterday, the China virus poses the greatest threat to our senior citizens as we all know. The median age for those who die from the virus is 78-years-old and nearly half of the deaths have occurred among those living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities. That’s really something.
President Donald Trump: (01:17)
In other words, approximately half of the fatalities have occurred among less than 1% of the US population. So think of that, less than 1%, half of the fatalities. So we know what to look for. From the beginning, we have made it our top priority to shelter our seniors. In early March, we announced guidelines suspending all medically unnecessary visits to nursing homes and prioritized resources for those facilities. And we gave it a very strong priority.
President Donald Trump: (01:52)
FEMA has sent shipments to many different locations of protective equipment, and it’s going directly to 15,400 Medicaid and Medicare certified nursing homes throughout the country. Today, I’d like to provide an update on the additional actions we’ve been able to take and they’ve been very constructive. First, we’re requiring increased testing of the nursing home personnel in states where you had the worst outbreaks. All personnel will be tested at the highest level.
President Donald Trump: (02:26)
We’re distributing 15,000 rapid point of care diagnostic devices to support this effort. These are the tests where it takes five minutes to 15 minutes. They’re very accurate. They’re very good. And we’re sending them all over the country. And over 600 devices will be also shipped this week to additional facilities.
President Donald Trump: (02:48)
Second, HHS we’ll be distributing an additional $5 billion from the Provider Relief Fund to all nursing homes. Nursing homes in higher risk areas will be receiving more funding. This money can be used to address critical needs, including the hiring of additional staff, increasing testing and providing technology support so residents can connect their families and they can connect to their families. They are having a tremendous time. They want to be with their loved ones. They can’t do it. So what we’re doing is we’re working it so that we can connect, have them connect with their families if they’re not able to visit.
President Donald Trump: (03:28)
Third, we’ve been identifying especially high-risk nursing homes and sharing that information with the governors so that the governors and their staffs can take appropriate action. We’re able to find because of the testing programs and other means we’re able to find certain areas that are very high-risk. The governors can then take action. Additionally, CMS, CDC and the U.S. Public Health Service are providing enhanced technical assistance and support, including visits to the highest risk nursing homes and that’s their priority right now. Nursing homes, but the highest risk nursing homes.
President Donald Trump: (04:06)
CMS and CDC are implementing a national training program, focused on infection control for those nursing homes that need it most. And we have them surveyed and we have them mostly pinpointed. Over the past few months, we’ve created a surveillance system to detect outbreaks and currently 99% of all nursing homes are reporting directly to it. So we have great data. When a nursing home has three or more cases, we alert this state and make sure that it responds very quickly. We check on it and make sure they respond very quickly.
President Donald Trump: (04:40)
I want to send a message of support and hope to every senior citizen who has been dealing with the struggle of isolation in what should be the golden years of your life. We will get to the other end of that tunnel very quickly, we hope. The light is starting to shine. We will get there very quickly, but we send our love. We send a message of love, very important. We’re with you all the way.
President Donald Trump: (05:05)
As far as the outbreak in the Sunbelt, I said yesterday, we continue to vigorously combat the rise of cases in the south and southwest and the west. We’re closely monitoring and aggressively acting to control the infection in Texas, Arizona, California, Florida. Arizona is starting to come down, done a very good job. They’re all doing a good job. They’re very talented people. There are likely a number of causes for the spike in infections. Cases started to rise among young Americans shortly after demonstrations, which you know very well about. Which presumably triggered a broader relaxation of mitigation efforts nationwide and substantial increase in travel also was a cause.
President Donald Trump: (05:53)
Increased gathering on holidays, such as Memorial Day, as well as young people closely congregating at bars and probably other places, maybe beaches, four or five different listed places. We have 12 that are listed on the guide likely also contributed. We’re also sharing a 2000-mile border with Mexico, as we know very well and cases of surging in Mexico, unfortunately. I was with the president and it’s a big problem for Mexico, but cases are surging very sharply all across the rest of the Western Hemisphere. 257 miles of newly constructed wall along the southern border has had a great positive impact on people coming in.
President Donald Trump: (06:43)
And we have record low numbers of people coming in illegally. That’s helped greatly. It was really meant for a different purpose, but it worked out very well for what we’re doing right now and for the pandemic. Nationwide beyond the outbreak in several states, cases remained low and very stable. 19 States have positive test rates of less than 5%. Eight states have positive test rates of less than 2%. Our nationwide positive test rate is beginning to decline and is currently at 8.8% compared to over 16% at its peak in April, it’s coming down, it’s coming down fairly rapidly.
President Donald Trump: (07:21)
Today, we surpassed first time, we surpassed 50 million tests. That’s far more than any country in the world. India is second we believe. We think 1.4 billion people, that’s about 12 million tests. We have 50 million tests. We’re working with every state to ensure the supply of Remdesivir for early case intervention and steroid treatment and various other treatments for those that are seriously ill. We’re working very closely with hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, everybody. The Remdesivir has proven to be terrific.
President Donald Trump: (08:04)
Our case fatality rate continues to decline and we want to push this rate even lower. The therapeutic research continues daily for new and very promising treatments, including antibody treatments and the use the blood thinners and steroids. A lot of different things are happening and a lot of things are coming out that we wouldn’t have known a number of months ago. We’re doing tremendously well on therapeutic research and tremendously well on the vaccines. And frankly, therapeutically, or maybe a word even beyond that word is cure would be the best of all and we’ll see what happens.
President Donald Trump: (08:43)
But that would be great if we could go into the hospital and just cure people we’re at a position where we’re actually able to, to a certain extent with what we have right now. And we think in a very short period of time we’ll be able to do that. Our strategy is to shelter the highest risk Americans while allowing younger and healthiest citizens to return to work or school while being careful and very vigilant. Wear a mask socially distance and repeatedly wash your hands. Practice very, very good sanitary means.
President Donald Trump: (09:18)
You have to do this. You have to look at it differently. Wash your hands often. I’m finding more and more people are saying, “Wash your hands.” So wash your hands. We want young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. And we’re all in this together. And as Americans we’re going to get this complete, we’re going to do it properly. We’ve been doing it properly. Sections of the country come up, that we didn’t anticipate for instance, Florida, Texas, et cetera.
President Donald Trump: (09:49)
But we’re working with very talented people, very brilliant people and it’s all going to work out and it is working out. So with that, I’ll take a few questions, please. Yeah, please.
Speaker 2: (10:01)
Mr. President, I just want to ask you a question about the surge of federal agents to various cities. The mayor of Chicago just said moments ago that you’re doing this to divert attention from your failures on coronavirus. You are only targeting cities-
President Donald Trump: (10:16)
But we haven’t had that failure.
Speaker 2: (10:16)
You are only targeting cities though run by Democrats. Is this just a political stunt?
President Donald Trump: (10:19)
Yeah. The cities, unfortunately, that are in trouble are all run by Democrats. You have radical left Democrats running cities like Chicago, and so many others that we just had a news conference. And unfortunately that’s the way it is. I mean, that’s the facts. When you look at Chicago and you look at the job, Mayor Lightfoot sent me a letter yesterday and I think in their own way, they want us to go in. There’ll be a time when they’re going to want us to go in full blast. But right now, we’re sending extra people to help. We’re arresting a lot of people that have been very bad.
President Donald Trump: (10:53)
As far as the coronavirus, as you say, I think we’ve done some amazing things. And I think you’ll probably see that if you compare our statistics to other countries. And if you look at death rates, et cetera, you’re going to see. And especially into the future with what’s happening, you’re going to see some very, very impressive numbers for the United States. John, please. Go ahead, John.
John: (11:17)
Mr. President, do you plan to do a national strategy to help schools reopen and reopen safely? And regarding the children and your family, your son and your grandchildren, are you comfortable? Do you plan to have them back in person in school this fall?
President Donald Trump: (11:32)
Yeah. Well, I am comfortable with that and we do have a national strategy, but as you know, ultimately it’s up to the governors of the states. I think most governors, many governors want these schools to open. I would like to see the schools open especially when you see statistics like this. We have great statistics on young people and on safety. So we would like to see schools open. We want to see the economy open.
President Donald Trump: (11:54)
We just had a report literally as I walked in, that we set an all-time record on housing, price increases are up. I think they said 21%, which is a record that’s never happened before. That’s a great sign. We have an economy that’s going to be booming. A lot of jobs are being produced. The job numbers will be coming out shortly, meaning over the next week or so. And I think it’ll be a continuation of the last two months. The last two months have been incredible. So I think we’re going to have a great economy. You’re going to have a fantastic next year.
President Donald Trump: (12:24)
I think you’re going to have a very good third quarter actually where the third quarter numbers come out. Interestingly, there’ll be announced just before the election. There’ll be announced around November 1st. So yeah, I would like to see the schools open, open a 100% and we’ll do it safely. We’ll do it carefully. But when you look at the statistics I just read having to do with children and safety, they’re very impressive. They have very strong immune systems.
John: (12:52)
But you would understand that the children who go to school then go back to home. Some live with their grandparents, there’s a real risk. Would you understand if some schools-
President Donald Trump: (12:59)
They do say that they don’t transmit very easily and a lot of people are saying they don’t transmit. And we’re looking at that. We’re studying, John very hard, that particular subject, that they don’t bring it home with them now. They don’t catch it easily. They don’t bring it home easily. And if they do catch it, they get better fast. We’re looking at that fact. That is a factor and we’re looking at that very strongly. We’ll be reporting about that over the next week. Please.
Speaker 4: (13:25)
Mr. President, at least three governors today came out with new orders on mask requirements. Is that something you wish all the governors would do?
President Donald Trump: (13:35)
Well, a lot of the governors, they have different requirements. Some of the governors are really strong on masks, others aren’t. I think it’s really going to ultimately be up to them. We’ve given them the facts we’ve given them everything we know. They have their own facts. Some are strong on masks. And as you know, some aren’t in the same ballpark. Well, I think all is suggesting if you want to wear a mask, you wear it. I bring one, I have one, I’ve worn it. And I think when I’m in certain settings like hospitals or when I’m close, when you can’t socially distance, I believe in it.
President Donald Trump: (14:10)
Let’s see. Do I? I have it. And in certain instances, I think you want to travel with a mask. There are instances where you really can use it. I would believe it would be a good thing. Yeah, please.
Speaker 5: (14:26)
D.C. Mayor Bowser came out with such an order today. It, of course doesn’t apply to federal properties, but would you encourage federal properties and including the White House complex to follow the order?
President Donald Trump: (14:39)
We’re going to make a decision over the next 24 hours. We’ll let you know what that decision is. Okay.
Speaker 5: (14:44)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (14:44)
Okay. Thank you. Please.
Speaker 6: (14:46)
President Trump, do you agree with some Republicans discussing the possibility of extending short-term unemployment insurance today so that they prevent benefits from expiring?
President Donald Trump: (14:57)
Well, I think a lot of politicians are discussing that Republicans, Democrats and right now a lot of my representatives are on the hill. They’re discussing CARES Act or Phase 4, whatever you want to call it. And I think ultimately something good will come out of it. The economy is starting to really come back strongly. When you look at the numbers, even with the fact that like California is still closed up in many big states. I think the numbers are even more impressive considering that some states like California, big ones are pretty well shut down. So we expect to have something over a period of time, over the appropriate period of time.
Speaker 7: (15:34)
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. These two questions are with Andrew Feinberg and J.C. [Buehler 00:15:39] One is today said you’re sending federal law enforcement officers to run cities front by extreme politicians. That’s the word you used, which who happened to be all Democrats, who supported Black Lives Matter protests. [crosstalk 00:15:53]
President Donald Trump: (15:54)
I said, Democrat politicians. And these are the cities where you have the problem. If you look at Chicago, if you look at Detroit. I mean, look around any of these cities where we have the problems and we’re sending them help. But we’re really waiting for them to call for the big help for the big numbers, for the large numbers of people that we have ready, willing and able. You look at Chicago where 14 people were shot yesterday were over the weekend. Many people died and many people were shot. And over the last month, they’re setting record numbers.
President Donald Trump: (16:27)
We are waiting for the mayor respectfully and other mayors and governors to call us. We are ready, willing, and able to go in there with great force. Now, we also have people that are going in and arresting drug dealers, arresting some of the shooters that are doing the shooting. We know who they are. We’re working with police forces. And even though in some cases they’re told don’t work with the federal government, the police forces have great respect for the federal government and what we do. But we’re ready, willing, and able to go into these cities that are just being decimated with shooting and we’re going to help. Please.
Speaker 8: (17:01)
I have a question on crime, but first I don’t think we’ve really got an explanation yesterday on why the health experts are no longer joining you at these briefings. Can you explain why?
President Donald Trump: (17:11)
Because they’re briefing me. I’m meeting them. I just spoke to Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx is right outside and they’re giving me all of everything they know as of this point in time and I’m giving the information to you. And I think it’s probably a very concise way of doing it. It seems to be working out very well.
Speaker 8: (17:32)
Okay, so on crime-
President Donald Trump: (17:34)
They’re very much involved. They’re very much with the relationships are all very good. All very good. The relationships that we have with the doctors, with everybody working on the virus has been, I think, extraordinary. Kayleigh’s here and I think you would say the same thing. You work them all the time. Yeah, go ahead please.
Speaker 8: (17:50)
So in 2016, you said it was President Obama’s fault that homicides were up in Chicago. So why was it the president’s fault then? But it’s not your fault now?
President Donald Trump: (18:01)
Chicago is a disaster. The mayor is saying, “Don’t come in.” The mayor is telling us not to come in. At some point, we can void that if we have to and we may have to because it’s out of control. I assume she’s saying that for political reasons. I think it’s negative political reasons. She’s a Democrat. I’m going to be nice. She’s a Democrat. She’s making a big mistake. People are dying in Chicago and other cities and we can solve the problem. They have to ask us, but we can solve the problem.
Speaker 8: (18:34)
Why was it President Obama’s fault In 2016? You credited it as-
President Donald Trump: (18:35)
Because President Obama was invited in and he did a poor job. President Obama could have gone into Chicago, he could have solved the problem and he didn’t. In our case, they don’t want us in. We can solve the problem very easily. We’re equipped with the best equipment, the best people. And you see what we’re doing. I mean, Portland was coming down. It was busting at the seams. And we went in and protected all the federal buildings. Those federal buildings are totally protected and we had to do that.
President Donald Trump: (19:02)
And Portland’s a very different place than Chicago, but Chicago should be calling us. And so should Philadelphia and Detroit and others to go in and really help them. Because when you’re losing many people a weekend, many, many people, you see the same numbers as I do. When you’re losing these people, they should call us and they should say, “Come on in.” And it’s incredible to me, but they’re not doing it. At some point, they will. At some point we may have no other choice, but to go in. Jeff, please.
Jeff: (19:29)
Mr. President, are you looking at closing further Chinese embassies in the United States? And did you ask Ambassador Woody Johnson to bring the British Open to your Turnberry property in Scotland?
President Donald Trump: (19:40)
No, I never spoke to Woody Johnson about that about Turnberry. Turnberry is a highly respected course, as you know, one of the best in the world. And I read a story about it today and I never spoke to Woody Johnson about doing that, no. As far as closing additional embassies, it’s always possible. You see what’s going on. We thought there was a fire in the one that we did close. And everybody said, “There’s a fire, there’s a fire.” And I guess they were burning documents or burning papers. And I wonder what that’s all about. Okay. I have about one or two more. Please.
Speaker 10: (20:14)
Thank you. Would you like to respond to Joe Biden? Who today described you, you might’ve heard that as the first racist to be elected president. Those were his words.
President Donald Trump: (20:24)
You know it’s interesting because we did criminal justice reform. We passed criminal justice reform, something that Obama and Biden were unable to do. We did opportunity cities. We did the greatest if you look at what we’ve done with opportunities zones, nobody’s ever even thought of a plan like that. Prior to the China plague coming in, floating in, coming into our country and really doing terrible things all over the world, doing terrible things, we had the best African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, almost every group was the best for unemployment.
President Donald Trump: (21:04)
The unemployment numbers were the best. So you look at employment, you look at opportunities zones, and maybe most importantly, you look at criminal justice reform, you look at prison reform. I’ve done things that nobody else and I’ve said this, and I say it openly. And not a lot of people dispute it. I’ve done more for black Americans than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close. Thank you very much, everybody."

Thank you very much. Thank you. Great honor to be with you today. Being here is a really important moment as far as I’m concerned. My first duty as president is to protect the American people. Today, I’m taking action to fulfill that sacred obligation.
President Trump: (00:32)
In recent weeks, there has been a radical movement to defund, dismantle and dissolve our police departments. Extreme politicians have joined this anti-police crusade and relentlessly vilified our law enforcement heroes. To look at it from any standpoint, the effort to shut down policing in their own communities has led to a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders, and heinous crimes of violence. This bloodshed must end. This bloodshed will end. Today, I’m announcing a surge of federal law enforcement into American communities plagued by violent crime. We’ll work every single day to restore public safety, protect our nation’s children and bring violent perpetrators to justice. We’ve been doing it and you’ve been seeing what’s happening all around the country. We’ve just started this process. Frankly, we have no choice but to get involved.
President Trump: (01:37)
With us today is Attorney General Bill Barr; thank you, Bill, very much; acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf; Chad, thank you; and FBI Director Christopher Wray; thank you, Chris, very much. We’re also pleased to be joined by Americans who have tragically lost their loved ones to recent violence. To each of you, please know that America grieves with you, that we pledged to honor the memory of your cherished loved ones by fighting to bring safety. Every single community, we will bring that safety, you will see. For decades, politicians running many of our nation’s major cities have put the interest of criminals above the rights of law abiding citizens. These same politicians have now embraced the far-left movement to break up our police departments causing violent crime in their cities to spiral, and I mean spiral seriously out of control.
President Trump: (02:40)
In New York City, over 300 people were shot in the last month alone, a 277 at least percent increase over the same period of a year ago. Murders this year have spiked 27% in Philadelphia and 94% in Minneapolis compared to the same period in 2019. Perhaps no citizens have suffered more from the menace of violent crime than the wonderful people of Chicago, a city I know very well. At least 414 people have been murdered in the city this year, a roughly 50% increase over last year. More than 1,900 people have been shot. These are numbers that aren’t even to be believed. Yesterday alone, 23 people were shot in Chicago, including at least 15 who were shot in a merciless onslaught of gunfire outside of a funeral home. 63 people were shot in the city this past weekend and at least 12 people were killed. Over the 4th of July weekend, nearly 80 people were shot and 17 were killed. Over Father’s Day weekend, 104 people were shot and 15 were killed, including five young children. The last weekend in May saw the city’s deadliest day on record, 18 murders in 24 hours.
President Trump: (04:13)
Behind each of these horrifying statistics is a victim, a family, a loved one and a life of cruelly shattered. It’s just so sad to see and so sad to look and so sad to see how these lives have been just torn apart. An African-American father of three was killed while walking into a store to pay his cellphone bill. A 13-year-old girl was killed when a stray bullet came through the window of her home and hit her in the neck in the presence of her family. On Independence Day, 14-year-old Vernado Jones, Jr. was playing basketball with friends in a Chicago park when he was senselessly killed in a massacre that left eight people dead or wounded. Vernado’s mother, Cheryl, is here with us today. Cheryl, please know that all Americans mourn by your side. We will carry your son’s memory. He will not be forgotten. Cheryl? Cheryl?
Cheryl Jones: (05:15)
I’m here.
President Trump: (05:16)
Thank you very much. Thank you for being here, Cheryl. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to meet you before. Thank you.
President Trump: (05:24)
This rampage of violence shocks the conscience of our nation. We will not stand by and watch it happen, can’t do that. The citizens of Chicago are citizens of America and they have the same rights as every other American to live in safety, dignity and peace. No mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms, simply because politicians refuse to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city. Every American, no matter their income, their race or their zip code, should be able to walk their city streets free from violence and free from fear.
President Trump: (06:02)
For this reason, today, I am announcing that the Department of Justice will immediately surge federal law enforcement to the city of Chicago. The FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security will together be sending hundreds of skilled law enforcement officers to Chicago to help drive down violent crime. Murderers and violent criminals are breaking a wide range of federal laws. We have that. It’s as wide as it can be. We will find them, arrest them and prosecute them. They will be in jail for many years to come. We will work with local police to identify violations of state and local laws to help ensure that offenders are caught and jailed for their crimes.
President Trump: (06:52)
But, we must remember that the job of policing a neighborhood falls on the shoulders of local elected leadership. We can never forget that. When they abdicate their duty, the results are catastrophic. Americans must hold their city leaders accountable. They must insist that community officials fully support, fully back and fully fund their local police departments. There is simply no substitute for a police department that has the strong backing of city leaders. In the meantime, we will use federal law enforcement to vigorously charge federal crimes and support these besieged communities to the greatest extent possible. This will be hard, painstaking work. It will take time. The tide will not recede overnight, but we will marshal all of the strength and focus and determination that we can possibly do. This is a critical effort. We will continue to call on state and local leaders to do their job and protect their citizens.
President Trump: (07:58)
The operation in Chicago will be done as part of Operation Legend, which was recently launched in Kansas City, Missouri. Very successfully, I might add, it is named after LeGend Taliaferro, a four-year-old boy who’s shot, think of this, who was shot and killed last month while he lay asleep in his home. LeGend’s mother grieves, our hearts and pains and souls, and we thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. We are profoundly grateful to be joined by Charron. Would you please stand, Charron? Charron, please? Also, LeGend’s father, Raphael, and his grandparents, Alfred and Pauline. Yes? You look so great, so great. Thank you very much. I appreciate your nice statements before, too. Thank you very much.
Charron Powell: (08:56)
Thank you.
President Trump: (08:56)
Thank you. LeGend is looking down. He’s very proud of you right now, I tell you. Thank you very much. To LeGend’s family-
President Trump: (09:03)
Tell you. Thank you very much. To LeGend’s family, we cannot even begin to imagine your anguish and your sorrow but we solemnly promise to honor LeGend and we will be fighting every day to save the lives of America’s children. Under Operation Legend, we will also soon send federal law enforcement to other cities that need help. Other cities need help, they need it badly, t hey should call, they should want it, they’re too proud or they’re too political to do that. One of them is Albuquerque, New Mexico where last fall 55-year-old Jackie Vigil was murdered as she was getting into her car to go to the gym. We’re joined today by her husband Sam and her sons Raul and Kevin, both New Mexico state police officers. Would you please stand? Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you. Great looking family, thank you very much. To Sam, Raul and Kevin, we’re moved beyond words by your presence here today. We thank you very much for being here, it’s a great honor to meet you. This afternoon I’m also announcing that the Department of Justice will provide more than $61 million in grants to hire hundreds of new police officers in cities that are the focus of Operation Legend. We will never defund the police, we will hire more great police. We want to make law enforcement stronger, not weaker. What cities are doing is absolute insanity. Many of the same politicians who want to slash resources for law enforcement have also declared that their cities are sanctuaries for criminal illegal aliens. In other words after arresting illegal aliens for crimes, the police are ordered to release those criminals back onto the streets to continue their crime. Last year, Chicago politicians forced the release of illegal aliens charged with crimes such as assault, armed robbery, strangulation and attempted murder. My administration will be working to remove dangerous offenders sprung loose by these deadly policies and frankly by these deadly politicians.
President Trump: (11:20)
America must be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens, not criminal aliens. My vision for America’s cities could not be more different from the lawlessness being pushed by the extreme radical left. While others want to defund, defame and abolish the police, I want to support and honor our great police. While the radicals want to abolish charter schools that eliminate school choice, I want to expand school choice and every family in America should have that option. While others want to destroy opportunity, shut down businesses and send our jobs overseas, we are hiring Americans and we are buying American product. We want to build factories in Baltimore, not Beijing. We want to make our products in Chicago, not Shanghai. We want the American dream for American children and I will fight to deliver that dream every ounce, every single ounce of my strength, I will be fighting, but opportunity cannot thrive where there is violence, prosperity cannot flourish where there is bloodshed, and security cannot exist where there are violent criminals who are able to maim and murder with impunity.
President Trump: (12:37)
That is what Operation Legend is all about. That is why we are here today, to answer the pleas of those crying for justice and crying for help. For those people in Chicago and other cities where we’ll be, help is on its way. I’d now like to ask Attorney General William Barr is doing a fantastic job to explain Operation Legend in greater detail, followed by Acting Secretary Wolf and then we’ll hear from loved ones of fallen Americans. I’ll ask Sam Vigil and [Sharon Powell 00:13:14] to the podium and we’d love to hear them say a few words in honor of their loved one. Thank you very much. Please, Bill.
William Barr: (13:28)
Thank you Mr. President and I’d like to thank especially the families of the victims who have come here today and have allowed us to inaugurate this effort in the name of their loved ones. I’d like to thank all our law enforcement colleagues from around the country, state, local and federal. As the president said, the first duty of government is to protect the safety of our citizens and we’re here to explain the initiative to combat rising violent crime in a number of our cities. Our goal is to help save lives. The principle danger to the lives of our inner city communities is violent crime. The leading cause of death for young black males is homicide. Each year, approximately 7,500 black Americans are the victims of homicide. Every one of those lives matter.
William Barr: (14:38)
In 1992, violent crime was nationwide, was double what it is today, and it was at that time that federal law enforcement first turned its attention to this kind of violent crime. Before that, the federal government really didn’t play that much of a role in it, but we started to attack violent crime in conjunction with state and local government. It was at that time for example that the FBI set up its anti-gang task forces throughout the United States and we started using our strong federal laws that permit us to target those who use guns to kill others and those that are involved in gang activity. Our approach was to set up anti violent crime task forces in the cities to enforce federal law and take the shooters and the chronic violent criminals off the streets. We helped pay for state and local officers to join these task forces so we could leverage our strength and this approach was extremely successful in the intervening decades in driving crime down.
William Barr: (15:59)
Now at the end of the Obama administration, crime started going back up again, and for the first two, two and a half years of this administration, we were succeeding in pushing it down but less than a year ago, Mr. President, you’ll recall that as we saw crime starting to go up in a few cities, you asked me to initiate a surge in those cities to help our state and local partners deal with it and so we did start this program which we called Relentless Pursuit. Unfortunately, COVID intervened and we had to abort that effort. Since then, we had that terrible event in Minneapolis but then we had this extreme reaction that has demonized police and called for the defunding of police departments, and what we have seen then is a significant increase in violent crime in many [inaudible 00:16:54] cities, and this rise is a direct result of the attack on the police forces and the weakening of police forces and the president’s gone through the terrible statistics.
William Barr: (17:11)
So in response to that, we have initiated this program, Operation Legend, to step up the activity of our task forces, our anti-crime task forces in the hard hit cities by committing more federal agents and supporting more state and local task force officers. It’s important to stress that the operations we’re talking about are the standard, anti-crime fighting activities we have been carrying out around the country for decades. We will be adding federal agents to the task forces. These are street agents, they’re investigators who will be working to solve murders and to take down the violent gangs and they’ll be working shoulder to shoulder
William Barr: (18:03)
Gangs. And they will be working shoulder to shoulder with our state and local colleagues. This is a different kind of operation obviously, than the tactical teams we use to defend against riots and mob violence. And we’re going to continue to confront mob violence, but the operations we’re discussing today are very different. They are classic crime fighting. We have named the operation, as we’ve said, operation LeGend. And we started rolling it out a couple of weeks ago in Kansas City. And just to give you an idea of what’s possible, the FBI went in very strong into Kansas City and within two weeks we’ve had 200 arrests. We will be adding cities in the weeks ahead. And for now we’re including beyond Kansas City, as the president said, Chicago and Albuquerque. The FBI is today announcing rewards for information related to the killing of LeGend, Jackie and Vernado. We are seeking justice for those victims today. And Operation LeGend aims to immediately help our police agencies and our local leadership to prevent additional victims.
William Barr: (19:23)
The FBI has established a hotline for the public to report information they may have that may help in solving these murders. The hotline number is 1-800 call FBI. To carry out Operation LeGend, federal law enforcement agencies will be committing additional resources to these cities, including FBI agents, DEA, ATF, the U.S. marshals and the Department of Homeland Security, HSI teams. Today, we have sent over 200 federal agents to Kansas City. We are directing a comparable number of agents to augment Chicago’s existing task forces. And we are providing an additional 35 agents to Albuquerque. The United States attorneys for Chicago, Albuquerque and Kansas City are here today. These U.S. attorneys and the chief federal law enforcement officials in each of these cities are ultimately responsible for coordinating the federal effort and ensuring prosecutions from this initiative are effective.
William Barr: (20:36)
Linked to this increase in federal law enforcement agents, we are also providing additional financial assistance to the state and local enforcement agencies to permit them to provide more cops, more members of our task force. As I said, federal agents work hand in glove with state and local law enforcement every day we supplement and provide support to local law enforcement, but violent crime is ultimately a problem that will be solved by state and local leadership in these cities, as the president said. Our announcement today is a demonstration of our commitment to the men and women who serve as police officers in Chicago, Albuquerque, and Kansas City. Your efforts to protect these communities are not forgotten. So to this announcement and Operation LeGend as a whole, is also a commitment to the families of LeGend Taliferro, Jackie Vigil and Vernado James. That those names will not be forgotten. We will not rest until justice is delivered for your loved ones. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (22:06)
Well, Mr. President, thank you for the invitation to be here today. It’s always an honor to discuss the actions to protect and defend the peace and liberty we value in this country. Attorney General Barr, the partnership our departments have and executing a shared mission of protecting the Homeland and bringing justice to those who threaten it, remains as strong as ever. So thank you for your partnership. As the nation’s largest law enforcement agency, the Department of Homeland Security stands ready and able to commit our highly skilled, highly trained Homeland Security investigative special agents to help restore law and order. In the wake of 9/11, DHS was founded so that the federal government could better partner directly with state and local law enforcement. As DHS supports this critical effort led by the department of justice, Homeland Security investigative agents will leverage their networks, their assets, and their expertise to energize criminal investigations. Homeland Security investigations mission is to investigate some of the most violent criminals, specifically those involving transnational gangs and narcotics trafficking. And let me just take a quick moment to clearly make a distinction as the attorney general did about what is occurring in Portland versus the important action that we’re announcing here today. In Portland, we see almost two months of coordinated, violent attacks by anarchists against a federal courthouse and federal law enforcement officials sworn to protect it. In Chicago, we see an unprecedented rise in crime against fellow citizens. The DHS mission in Portland is to protect federal property and our law enforcement officers. In Chicago the mission is to protect the public from violent crime on the streets. Leaders of these great cities should not stand behind the status quo.
Speaker 1: (23:48)
They should stand with America. They should condemn these violent attacks and they should work with this administration and this president to bring about law and order. I know everyone’s standing here today. Every Homeland Security investigations agent assigned to Operation LeGend, and every reasonable American agrees with the basic premise that every four year old should be safe at night to sleep in their bed. The department grieves with all the families experiencing excruciating and heart wrenching stories of loss. We as a department stand resolute committed to working together across the federal government, and with our state and local law enforcement partners to keep that promise. So again, thank you, Mr. President. The department is grateful for your continued support of our law enforcement officers as we continue to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.
Donald Trump: (24:39)
Thank you very much.
Speaker 1: (24:39)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (24:40)
Thank you very much. Chris, do you want to say a few words, please? You’re going to be a big part of it. Come on, go ahead please.
Chris: (24:55)
The real measure of success of initiatives like Operation LeGend, is the ability of communities to feel safe. It’s not about the number of arrests. It’s about the ability of kids to be able to play outside of their homes, about families, to be able to walk to and from work. And that’s what this operation is designed to do. And it’s going to be a significant surge of federal resources to partner with our great state and local law enforcement partners to achieve safety. And the confidence that the American people need to have, that they can live safe in their community. So, thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (25:33)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Please. Please, please, sir.
Sam Vigil: (25:44)
I would start out by thanking you for… I never imagined that I would be in the same room with the most powerful person on earth. And thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (25:54)
Thank you very much.
Sam Vigil: (25:56)
Thank you, Mr. Barr. I would like to just very briefly make a few comments about my wife, the way she was. Jackie was the type of person that loved to go to the gym. That was one of her big things. She also liked to send out prayers on a daily basis to people. She would pick verses from the Bible, prayers that you came across with. And she would either email those prayers or tweet them to some of our friends there in Albuquerque. That all ended on November 19th. As I mentioned before, she was one of those people that had to go to the gym, otherwise she wouldn’t make it through the day. We usually get up around 4:30 to 4:45. She got up, I got up. I went downstairs, I got my cup of coffee. She came down and she says, well, I’ll see you in about an hour. That’s about how long she would spend at the gym. I heard the garage door open.
Sam Vigil: (27:03)
The gym. I heard the garage door open, and then all of a sudden, almost immediately after that, I heard the horn on the car. So I went out there and I thought maybe she forgot her gym card or something and wants me to go out there and take it back to her. When I opened the door, the garage door was open. There was a vehicle behind hers blocking her. And I still didn’t snap. I thought, well, maybe the guy that delivers the paper usually around that time of day was the one in the back of the car.
Sam Vigil: (27:42)
Then I noticed that that wasn’t so. Somebody had shot and killed her there. I saw a person walk over on the driver, I mean on the passenger side of the vehicle, that was behind her and get on and take off like crazy. To this day, I can’t forget that. Every time I go to bed, every time I go out into the driveway, that memory comes back, and it haunts me. And Jackie, my wife, did not deserve to be killed that way. Nobody does. Of course, Albuquerque, as you probably all know, those of you in law enforcement, has a reputation for being one of the most violent cities in the country actually. We’ve ranked up there in first place, second place, and that doesn’t seem to be going away. It’s been eight months since my wife died, and there’s been no arrests at all.
Sam Vigil: (28:44)
Nobody has been arrested for the crime. There are other victims in Albuquerque that are in the same boat. The journal reported back a couple of months ago that the rate of solving homicides in Albuquerque was less than 50%. And that in itself tells you a big story as to where we’re at and how we need desperately some help to get after the crime rates that we have going on there. And I really appreciate the effort that you all are putting into this, and I welcome that. And if there’s anything that I can do, please let me know. Thank you so much.
President Trump: (29:30)
Thank you very much, [inaudible 00:02:32]. We’re going to be giving a special effort to that when we go in. We have some very talented people going in. We’re going to give a very special effort to Jackie. Okay. Thank you very much. Charron, please. Thank you.
Charron Powell: (29:52)
Thank you. I appreciate the efforts. Good afternoon. I am Charron Powell. I am LeGend Taliferro’s mother. I want to thank God for giving me the strength to withstand today. Operation Legend is not to harass. It’s not to harm or to hurt. It is to help investigate unsolved murders, in which one of those happens to be our innocent four-year-old son. This operation is personal to us. We want justice for our son and others. We have to take a stand in our communities and speak up to help this operation be successful. My one and only child who fought through open heart surgery at four months is gone due to senseless gun violence. Children are supposed to be our future. And our four year old son didn’t make it to kindergarten. I stand here today as a mother fighting against violence for my son, LeGend Taliferro. My family and I support Operation Legend, and we strongly want our community and everyone else behind us.
Charron Powell: (31:01)
Thank you so much, you guys. I appreciate all the efforts. One thing about LeGend, he was exciting. He loved basketball. He was a ball of joy. And I want his legacy to live on, and I want us to continue to fight against violence and also get justice for my son and others. So with this operation, I want it to be successful. So if every community can reach out to that hotline if you know any information about any murder, that will be great, and also to keep carrying on his legacy. Thank you once again. I appreciate everything. Thank you.
President Trump: (31:43)
Thank you very much. And LeGend and Jackie are looking down right now at you and very proud, very proud. Thank you both. Thank you families for being here. Thank you. So to every family, I’m very proud to stand with you in this struggle. I’m proud to stand with the heroes of law enforcement. They are true heroes. Thank you all for being here. We appreciate it very much. Great, great people. And I’m proud to fight by your side to deliver a better future for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. As soon as the cities and states call to ask for help on a very large basis, we will be there with full force and we will stop this horrible situation very quickly. But in the meantime, we’re doing something that’s going to have an impact. And Mr. Attorney general, thank you very much. Chad, thank you very much. Do a good job. I have no doubt you will. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. See you later. Thank you."
"Jul 21, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Well, thank you very much and good afternoon. Today, I want to provide an update on our response to the China virus and what my administration is doing to get the outbreak in the Sun Belt under control, seems largely in Sun Belt, but could be spreading. My team is also working night and day with Capitol Hill to advance the next economic relief package. We’re working very hard on it. We’re making a lot of progress. I also know that both sides want to get it done. We’ll call it phase four. I think we’re going to get it done. We’ll protect our workers, our schools, and our families, and protect them very strongly. As one family, we mourn every precious life that’s been lost. I pledge in their honor that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We’re doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development.
Donald Trump: (01:00)
But I want to thank our brave doctors and nurses and frontline responders. The job they do is incredible and they are truly brave. My administration will stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable, which is so important. We’ve learned so much about this disease and we know who the vulnerable are and we are going to indeed shield them. And again, the vaccines are coming and they’re coming a lot sooner than anyone thought possible, by years. If you look at the old system and look at the new system, I think by years. The China virus is a vicious and dangerous illness, but we’ve learned a great deal about it and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that’s going to be very, very powerful. We’ve developed as we go along.
Donald Trump: (01:51)
Some areas of our country are doing very well. Others are doing less well. It will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better. Something I don’t like saying about things, but that’s the way it is. It’s what we have. You look over the world. It’s all over the world. And it tends to do that. The governors are working very, very hard and we are supporting them 100%. Everything they need they get, and we are taking good care. We have tremendous supplies and a great supply chain, whether it’s ventilators or gowns or just about anything they need. So that’s a big difference from inheriting very, very empty cupboards.
Donald Trump: (02:33)
The median age of those who succumb to the China virus is 78 years old. Roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes who are long term care. In one study, 90% of those hospitalized had underlying medical conditions, whether it’s heart or diabetes, but usually it’s some kind of a condition. It seems that people have that and if they do, it’s a problem, no question about it. Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won’t even know they’re sick. They won’t have any idea that they have a virus. They won’t have any idea at all. America’s youth will act responsibly. And we’re asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask. Get a mask. Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact. They’ll have an effect and we need everything we can get.
Donald Trump: (03:29)
Data shows children have the lowest fatality risk. 99.96% of all virus fatalities are in adults. Think of that. So that’s much, much, much less than 1% for children, young people. By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we’ve been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States. In fact, we’ll show you a chart and how well we do compared to the rest of the world. We have several treatments already available that significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including Remdesivir, which has been very successful, and a widely available steroid treatment, and we have many more happening and coming out. We’ve learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we’ve shared them all over the world, that the relationship with other countries has been very strong.
Donald Trump: (04:33)
We’re all working together. This includes ensuring all hospitals are aware of the importance of different approaches to oxygen treatment including high flow oxygen, the importance of steroid treatment for those on ventilators. And when you’re on a ventilator, we’ve learned a tremendous about the use of the ventilator. And at the beginning, people never had an experience like this, where we needed so many ventilators so fast, and even the use of the ventilators, but the doctors and nurses and helpers have become incredibly good at the use of a ventilator, which is actually a very complicated procedure. And allocating Remdesivir to hospitals based on new admission since it works best early in hospitalization. And that’s something that they’ve really started. They’re using it much earlier.
Donald Trump: (05:26)
Fatalities nationwide have fallen 75% since mid April. That’s a great number. As cases and fatalities rise in certain hard hit states, which you’re looking at right now, we’re surging personnel, supplies and therapeutics. We again have tremendous amounts of supplies. We are in very good shape and we can move them quickly. Our case fatality rate has continued to decline and is lower than the European union and almost everywhere else in the world. If you watch American television, you’d think that the United States was the only country involved with and suffering from the China virus. Well, the world is suffering very badly, but the fact is that many countries are suffering very, very, very badly, and they’ve been suffering from this virus for a long time. We’ve done much better than most. And with the fatality rate at a lower rate than most, it’s something that we can talk about, but we’re working again with them because we’re helping a lot of countries that people don’t even know about.
Donald Trump: (06:32)
I get calls all the time asking for help, especially as it pertains to the ventilators. They need help with ventilators. They have to get them. They’re very hard to get. We’re making thousands now a month, thousands of ventilators a month. It’s been quite amazing. We keep doing the good job and things will get better and better. We’ll be putting up charts behind me showing different statistics and different rates of success. And I guess you could say also things that we can do better on, but you’ll see them. They’ll be put up as we go. In April, the average age of individuals who tested positive for the virus was over 50 years old. Today, the average age is significantly younger. Hospital lengths of stay are almost half of what they were in April. So the stays are about half. The rate of cases requiring hospitalization has been reduced. And mortality among those admitted to the hospital is nearly one half of what it was in April.
Donald Trump: (07:35)
We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about this disease, how to handle it. The doctors have learned a lot, not only in the use of the ventilators, but in many other things and things are happening, too, like the Remdesivir and other elements, steroids, etc. But these trends could change without our continued and relentless focus and that’s what we have. We have a relentless focus and it’s been that way from the beginning, but we’ve learned so much.
Donald Trump: (08:02)
As you know, in recent weeks, we’ve seen a concerning rise in the cases in many parts of our south. If you look at south, southwest and west, this growth in cases first began to appear in mid June, primarily among 18 to 35 year olds, many of whom were asymptomatic. We’re also facing the challenge of a significant spikes in virus cases across the rest of the western hemisphere, including Mexico. Mexico’s been hit very, very, very hard. As you know, the President, a great gentleman, was here two weeks ago and they have really been hit hard. Because we’ve achieved an nearly four fold increase in testing capacity in two months, we’re successfully identifying more asymptomatic and mild cases, some cases so mild that you really don’t even treat them. Some cases with children where they don’t even know that they’re ill. And I guess they’re not very ill because they recover almost immediately.
Donald Trump: (09:04)
Per capita, the U.S. is conducting 50% more tests than Europe, and we’ve conducted nearly three times as many tests as all of the other countries in the western hemisphere combined, be over 50 million tests. This allows us to isolate those who are infected, even those without symptoms, so we know exactly where it’s going and when it’s going to be there. We’re also working to reduce turnaround time. My administration has been aggressively responding to case growth in the Sun Belt and we continue to do so working very close with all governors, but right now, in particular, those governors. We’re coordinating closely with hospitals and governors. In the last three weeks, I’ve sent senior officials into nine states to meet with governors and provide recommendations to the various leaders of the state, including hospital administrators, etc.
Donald Trump: (10:01)
My administration currently has zero unfulfilled requests for equipment or anything else that they need from the governors. No governor needs anything right now, and we think we’ll have it that way till the end, because frankly, we are stocked up and ready to go wherever we have to go. We’ve nearly 7,000 National Guard and military medical personnel in Texas, California, Florida, and Arizona. That’s helping us greatly. Want to thank them very much. The military has been fantastic. We’re closely monitoring hospital capacity in these states. Hospitals are open for elective surgeries and other procedures. So hospitals are open for elective surgeries. We want Americans to get the medical treatments they need. All of the governors we’ve spoken with. Say they have enough bed capacity. That’s a great thing.
Donald Trump: (10:56)
Our initial shutdown was to prevent the overflow of our hospitals and to allow us to meet the demands caused by this global pandemic, including the ventilators, and a permanent shutdown was really never an option in terms of what we’re doing right now. This would be completely unsustainable, produce debilitating economic fall, back, and lead to catastrophic public health consequences. There are consequences to shutdowns and we’ve saved potentially millions of lives by doing the initial shutdown. But now we’re very aware of this disease. We understand the disease to a large extent. Nobody’s going to maybe ever fully understand it, but we’ll end up with a cure. We’ll end up with therapeutics. We’ll end up with a vaccine very soon, all three. We’re instead asking Americans to use masks, socially distance, and employ vigorous hygiene. Wash your hands every chance you get while sheltering high risk populations.
Donald Trump: (11:57)
We are imploring young Americans to avoid packed bars and other crowded indoor gatherings. Be safe and be smart. We’re surging testing capacity to identify and isolate cases. This includes a newly approved testing platform to nursing homes across the south. We’re being very, very vigilant with respect to nursing homes because you know all of the problems that we’ve had with so many people, so sadly they were infected, so that all of the staff had residents can be routinely tested and isolated to ensure our elderly are even more strongly protected than anybody else. That’s really the high risk people. The high risk wonderful people.
Donald Trump: (12:39)
Once this current surge in cases declines, the same testing platform will enable people to visit their loved ones after taking a test, which is a big difference. Ultimately, our goal is not merely to manage the pandemic, but to end it. We want to get rid of it as soon as we can. That is why getting a vaccine remains a top priority. Two vaccine candidates are entering the final stage of clinical trials this month. This was achieved in record time. It used to be years before you were in a position like we are right now. Four other vaccines will enter final trials in the following weeks. And we’re mass producing all of the top candidates so that the first approved vaccine will be available immediately, and logistically we have the military ready to go.
Donald Trump: (13:28)
We have great people, logistic, military people, a wonderful General, who’s waiting for the vaccine so they can distribute it in record time. That’s what’s going to happen. So our military is all set to go. We will deliver a vaccine, therapeutics, whatever it is is necessary, and defeat the virus once and for all. And I’ll take a few questions if you’d like. I will say this. I want to thank all of the staff, the White House staff, all of the doctors that we’ve been working with so closely, and it’s just a lot of very positive things are happening. It’s a nasty, horrible disease that should have never been allowed to escape China, but it did. And it infected the world and the world is suffering, but we’re going to get it taken care of. And we’re helping lots of other countries. John.
John: (14:19)
Mr. President, first, I just wanted to get a clarification. Your Press secretary said today that you sometimes take more than one test a day. Well, why is that and how often-
Donald Trump: (14:28)
Well, I didn’t know about more than one. I do take probably on average a test every two days, three days. And I don’t know of any time I’ve taken two tests in one day, but I could see that happening.
John: (14:38)
So Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill both said they want to see more money for testing. They want to send billions of dollars to the state so they can do more testing. And you probably saw Mick Mulvaney, the other day, said that his kids, it took them a week to get test results back. He said this is simply inexcusable given where we are in the pandemic. Do you think we have a problem with testing in this country right now? Are you in favor of more money for testing?
Donald Trump: (15:03)
We’ve done more testing by far than anybody. Some of the tests, because it is massive volume, it takes longer. Others of the tests, as you know, are very quick. They’re five minutes and 15 minute tests. And those are frankly, the ones that I prefer, but we’re doing massive numbers and the numbers are coming down. And as we go, as an example, there are thousands and thousands of kits being made right now, which give you a 15 minute and a five minute test. So we’ll be able to get those numbers down. Those numbers are similar in other places. They’re also doing massive numbers, numbers like nobody thought possible, but those numbers will be coming down. I agree. I think it’s a good thing if we can do that.
John: (15:42)
Were you in favor of more money for testing [crosstalk 00:15:43]-
Donald Trump: (15:43)
Well, they’re going to make a presentation to me tonight and tomorrow on that. And again, we’re leading the world. I think the second country [inaudible 00:00:15:50], we’re going to be over 50 million tests. Second country is India with 12 million. Then you have a seven million, six million and four million. I think that we are doing tremendous amount of testing. But if the doctors and the professionals feel that, even though we’re at a level that nobody ever dreamt possible, that they would like to do more, I’m okay with it.
John: (16:15)
Why are your doctors not with you here today? Where’s Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx?
Donald Trump: (16:18)
Well, Dr. Birx is right outside. Yes, please.
Speaker 4: (16:20)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’ve got two questions for you if that’s all right. Number one, I just wanted to know. In November, do you want the American people to judge you-
Donald Trump: (16:28)
Could you speak up, please?
Speaker 4: (16:30)
Do you want the American people to judge you on the ballot in November by how you handled this pandemic so far?
Donald Trump: (16:36)
This among other things. I think the American people will judge us on this, but they’ll judge us on the economy that I created and that already we’re creating. We’re setting record job numbers as you know. I think we’re going to have a very strong year next year. I think we’re going to have a very strong third quarter, a very good fourth quarter, but I think next year is going to be a record year. And I think they’re going to judge me on that. I think they are going to judge me on the tax cutting and the regulation cutting, which nobody’s ever done to the extent that we’ve been able to do it, on rebuilding the military, on how we’ve handled the VA, on the VA. We got Veterans Choice. Nobody thought that would be possible. That’s been many decades. They’ve been trying to get Veterans Choice.
Donald Trump: (17:16)
It’s called choice where they can go get a doctor if they have to wait online for two weeks or five weeks or two days. And frankly, that’s been a great thing. Veterans accountability, I think they’ll judge me on that. They’ll judge me on all of the things we’ve done. And I think we can say this with surety, that’s never been even challenged in three and a half years, the first three and a half years, the first years of a presidency, I don’t think any administration, any President has accomplished so much as we’ve accomplished from energy, to health, to so many other things. And then this came in, the plague, I call it the plague, the plague came in, terrible thing. Should’ve been stopped. Wasn’t stopped. It came in. We had to shut things down to save potentially millions of lives. We did that and now we’ve started them up. And I think we’ve really started it up very successfully. [crosstalk 00:18:07]
Speaker 5: (18:07)
Mr. President, thank you, Mr. President. You’ve been saying for months, the virus would simply disappear. And now you’re saying that it’s likely to get worse before it gets better. If it does keep getting worse, if Americans keep dying, are you responsible for them?
Donald Trump: (18:20)
Well, the virus will disappear. It will disappear. I always like to say, as you know, either way, when you look at it, the governors are working with me. I’m working with the governor. We’re working hand in hand. I think we’re all responsible. I view it as a team. Very good relationships with the governors, very, very good relationships. I could say I’m fully responsible, but you know, one day we had a virus come in and I closed the borders, did a lot of things that were very good. In fact, Dr. Fauci said we saved tens of thousands of lives when I closed the border and nobody wanted to do it. I wanted to do it.
Donald Trump: (18:55)
We closed the border to China. We put on the ban. We didn’t want people coming in from heavily infected China. Fairly shortly thereafter, I closed the borders from Europe, coming in from Europe. Those were tremendous moves. If it’s one person that’s too much, but we’re, let’s say 140,000. We could have double, triple, quadruple that number if we didn’t. So we did a lot of things right. We did a lot of things right including with equipment. So it’s a shame that it happened. It shouldn’t have happened. China should have stopped it. [crosstalk 00:19:28] Yes, go ahead, please.
Speaker 6: (19:28)
Thank you, President Trump. If I could, two questions. My first question is we have a very quick testing platform here at the White House.
Donald Trump: (19:39)
Yes.
Speaker 6: (19:40)
It’s great. You get tested very quickly. Do you think that it would be easier to reopen and restart businesses if we could produce more of those machines for people?
Donald Trump: (19:48)
We’re trying to do. That’s a great question. We’re trying very much to do that. So rather than sending your tests in, and you know, it goes through the mail one day, comes back another day no matter how they send them, it’s a day and a day. So that’s two days already wasted. And then if it spends, by the time you get it back, it’s three or four days if they do an efficient job. We’re trying to get the testing on site. I like it the best.
Speaker 6: (20:09)
Thank you. My second question, that’s a little bit different topic, but it’s one that a lot of people are talking about. Ghislane Maxwell is in prison, and so a lot of people want to know if she’s going to turn in powerful people. And I know you’ve talked in the past about Prince Andrew and you’ve criticized bill Clinton’s behavior. I’m wondering, do you feel that she’s going to turn into powerful men? How do you see that working out?
Donald Trump: (20:33)
I don’t know. I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly, I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well, whatever it is. I don’t know the situation with Prince Andrew. Just don’t know. Not aware of it. [crosstalk 00:20:51] Please, go ahead.
Speaker 7: (20:53)
On unemployment insurance, how much below $600 are you willing to go? And you said that the economy is bouncing back strong. So why do we need to even fund it at all?
Donald Trump: (21:04)
Well, the economy’s getting stronger and I think we have a chance to have a very strong economy, especially if some of the things that I just spoke about work. We want to have people go back and want to go back to work as opposed to be sort of forced into a position where they’re making more money than they expected to make, and the employers are having a hard time getting them back to work. So that was a decision that was made. I was against that original decision, but they did that. It still worked out well because it gave people a life line, a real life line. Now we’re doing it again.
Donald Trump: (21:36)
They’re thinking about doing 70% of the amount. The amount would be the same, but doing it in a little bit smaller initial amounts so that people are going to want to go back to work as opposed to making so much money that they really don’t have to. But we were very generous with them. I think that it’s been a tremendously successful program. The whole thing has been successful if you look. I mean, we’re in a pandemic and yet we’re producing tremendous number of jobs. That was something that nobody thought possible. Okay? Please.
Speaker 8: (22:05)
Mr. President, thank you very much. Yesterday you said that wearing a mask was an act of patriotism. If that is the case, why don’t you do it more frequently?
Donald Trump: (22:13)
Well, I do actually do it when I need. I mean, I carry the mask. I went into Walter Reed Hospital the other day. I have the mask right here and I carry it, and I will use it gladly, no problem with it. And I’ve said that. And I say, if you can use the mask, when you can, use the mask, if you’re close to each other, if you’re in a group. I would put it on when I’m in a group. If I’m in an elevator and there were other people with me, including like security people, it’s not their fault. They have to be in the elevator. I want to protect them also. I put on a mask. I have no problem with the masks. I view it this way. Anything that potentially can help and that certainly can potentially help is a good thing. I have no problem. I carry it. I wear it. You saw me wearing it a number of times and I’ll continue. Please. [crosstalk 00:23:01].
Speaker 8: (23:01)
Can I ask you a quick follow up?
Donald Trump: (23:02)
Go ahead. Please.
Speaker 8: (23:03)
Are you sending this messages though? Yesterday you tweeted out an image wearing a mask and then last evening we saw you not wearing a mask at your hotel.
Donald Trump: (23:11)
Well, I don’t know. The hotel, I was pretty far away from people, but I would say this. I’ve explained it I think very well. If you’re close together, I would put on the mask. And if you’re not, I would say that if you’re, for instance like here. You’ve been all tested. I’ve been tested. Oftentimes I’ll be with people that are fully tested. I’ve been tested. In theory, you don’t need the mask. I’m getting used to the mask. And the reason is, think about patriotism. Maybe it is. It helps. It helps. Now we have experts that have said in the recent past, that masks aren’t necessarily good to wear. You know that. But now they’ve changed their mind. If they change their mind, that’s good enough for me. So I wear it when appropriate. Please. [crosstalk 00:23:55]
Speaker 9: (23:54)
Thank you, sir. A lot of Americans may be surprised at your change of tone over all of this, some more perhaps realistic tone, some would look at it that way. The sudden embrace of masks, social distancing, the-
Donald Trump: (24:10)
No. I’ve always agreed with that. I mean, I’ve never fought either one, but certainly social distancing. That’s common sense. Six feet for me is common sense. I’d like to say maybe make it a little bit further.
Speaker 9: (24:22)
The idea that things will get worse perhaps before they get better here, and perhaps the realization that this resurgence, if you will, is for real, when you used to talk about it in terms of little fires being put out here and there. Would you respond to that-
Donald Trump: (24:38)
No, we have embers and fires and we have big fires. And unfortunately, now Florida is in a little tough, or in a big, tough position. You have a great Governor there. You have a great Governor in Texas. You have people that are very, very skilled people. And I think they’re going to handle it very well. Their hospital capacities are holding up, but Texas is a big state and it’s very well run, and so is Florida. And I think they’ll do a very good job.
Speaker 9: (25:04)
Are you changing your tone though, sir?
Donald Trump: (25:05)
Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 10: (25:06)
I just wanted to ask you about the issue of vaccines, which you already mentioned. Yesterday a study by a Chinese company showed some promising results for it’s coronavirus vaccine candidate. If China were first in developing the vaccine, or even if it works, would the administration be willing to work with China to bring a successful Chinese vaccine to the U.S.?
Donald Trump: (25:25)
Yeah, we’re willing to work with anybody that’s going to get us a good result. We’re very close to the vaccine. I think we’re going to have some very good results. We’re already in testing. Nobody thought that would be possible. Under the old system, it would be a year to two years before you could even think about using the word testing. And the reason we’re testing, I mean, they’ve had good results. So now we have to see. And they’re testing also for safety because they have to make sure it’s safe. And I think you’re going to see something over the next fairly short period of time, maybe very short period of time, having to do with therapeutics and vaccines that are very good. So we’ll be doing these quite often. We’re going to keep you abreast of this. And we’ll also talk about some of the other topics like our economy which is doing well. The stock market had another good day. I think they have a good day because they see a lot of positive things happening on this front, too. Thank you very much. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:26:19]"
"Jul 20, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Just to see what’s going at our meetings. So I figured let you come in, you’ll look and you’ll see, we have a lot of good things happening. We have tremendous progress on vaccines and therapeutics. We’re getting reports, we’re studying the reports very closely. I think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised with what’s going on the vaccine front and the therapeutic front. This is always the first topic.
President Donald Trump: (00:27)
Secondarily, but very importantly, we’re working and negotiating with the Democrats on trying to get a plan that helps small businesses, helps people, helps this country, and I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that. And the discussions are going on. Steve, do you want to say a few words as to where we are.
Steve Mnuchin: (00:45)
Yes, Mr. President. Mark and I have been working very hard over the last two weeks with Mitch and Kevin on really what we see as the focus is kids and jobs. The Recovery Act, Cares 4.0, we’ve spent an unprecedented amount money. The good news is a lot of the $3 trillion, we still have left to put in the economy and put back to work. We’re focused on starting with another trillion dollars. We think that will make a big impact. And the focus is, as I said, is really about kids, and jobs, and vaccines. We’re going to make sure that we have a vaccine by the end of the year for emergency use. And the plan is, we just updated the president and the vice president, they signed off on this. Mark and I will be meeting tomorrow with the Republicans at the lunch to give them a full briefing. And then we will also be reaching out to the Democrats to begin our discussions.
Steve Mnuchin: (01:37)
But, we are committed that by the end of this month, make sure that before the enhanced unemployment insurance expires, that we pass legislation so that we can protect Americans that are unemployed. Now, we’ve said the number one issue is we have to fix the technical fix on enhanced unemployment. We’re going to make sure that we don’t pay people more money to stay home than go to work. We want to make sure that people who can go to work safely can do so. We’ll have tax credits that incentivize businesses to bring people back to work. We’ll have tax credits for PPE, for safe work environment, and we’re going to have big incentives, money to the States for education, for schools that can open safely and do education. So, these are the priorities as well as liability protection. We want to make sure that frivolous lawsuits don’t prevent schools, universities, and businesses from reopening.
President Donald Trump: (02:35)
Okay. Mike?
Mike Pence: (02:38)
Well, Mr. President, I want to say how much we appreciate the leadership in The House and Senate. Today’s conversation is a continuation of your commitment to do whatever it takes to get the American people, American businesses and communities through this very challenging time. The outbreaks across the Sunbelt are serious, but because of the support that we’ve had from, frankly leaders in both political parties in the Congress of the United States. We’re meeting this moment with expanded testing, personal protective equipment, and as you said, Mr. President, with the development and distribution of therapeutics, and a rapid development of vaccines. That will all continue. But, it’s important that the Congress come together and provide additional resources for families that have been impacted, businesses that have been impacted. We’ll make sure our healthcare workers and our States have the resources that they need, but also, Mr. President, we’re going to continue to advance policies that will make it possible for us to open up America again and open up America’s schools.
Mike Pence: (03:48)
I look forward, I know as you do, and working with the leaders that are gathered here and members of Congress in both political parties to deliver another important element of a recovery package that will keep on working until we bring our country all the way back, and reach that day that we someday put this Coronavirus in the past.
President Donald Trump: (04:09)
Okay. Mitch.
Mitch McConnell: (04:13)
Yeah. Tomorrow begins the process of socializing what we’ve been discussing with the administration over the last two weeks with our members. And if you’re looking for a theme here, think liability protection for those who’ve been trying to deal with the pandemic. We don’t need an epidemic of lawsuits on the heels of the pandemic we’re already short on. Kids in school, jobs and healthcare will be the theme of the proposal that we hope to come together and present to our Republicans. And then as the Secretary of The Treasury indicated, obviously you can’t the bill in the Senate without the Democrats. And we’re going to talk to them as well.
President Donald Trump: (04:57)
Kevin?
Kevin McCarthy: (04:58)
Yes. Just to sum up what we’re looking at, if you’re sitting at home and you’re concerned that you don’t have a job, we want to make sure you’re able to come back. We don’t think any federal money should be spent that gives you a disincentive to work. We want to make sure we have incentives to keep going. For those small businesses, we want to make sure you can stay open. We want to make sure your kids can go back to school, but go back safely, not just for the children, but for the teachers as well. We continue to make strides to make sure we get to a vaccine, that we find a cure for this virus that we did not invite, that came from a foreign land. And I think that’s the focus that we have to be a part of.
Kevin McCarthy: (05:33)
Mitch talks about, and I think the fundamental, not just for schools, but for any businesses striving, whether they can open back up or not, they should not have an attack from any lawsuits. We need to give the protection that we rebuild, restore, and renew this country to where we were before and that we can do it together. That’s why we’re working here. We’ll be reaching out to the Democrats and I hope for that moment in time, we can put politics aside. That we look at one nation. That we don’t sit back and decide to rule within a Senate, that a minority denies the ability to have this debate, that denies the ability to help America unite and solve this problem once and for all.
Kevin McCarthy: (06:11)
We are making great strides when it comes to therapies. With this warp speed, history would write about this. When we get to the moment in time that we have this vaccine, they’ll write about how fast it would and no other country could do what we did, because of the ingenuity of this nation. And that’s the focus of what we’re trying to do. The safety of this country for our students, for our teachers, and for our businesses that were back to work again, stronger and safer, and more united.
President Donald Trump: (06:38)
It came from China. It should have never been allowed to get out. They could have stopped it. They could have stopped it easily. They chose not to. And we’ll have further reports on that. But, it came from China. They could have stopped it, they didn’t. They stopped it from going into China, but they didn’t stop him from going to the rest of the world. It didn’t stop it from going to Europe, to us. They should have stopped it. They could’ve stopped it. They weren’t transparent at all. They were the opposite. It’s not good. I spoke with the president of France this morning and I spoke with the president of Egypt. And we had a very, very good conversation, both of us, and all of us and all of us together. I had many conversations with leaders all over the world over the weekend and over the last couple of weeks in particular, and this is a pandemic that is flaring up all over the place. Countries said they were in good shape, and then all of a sudden, they have big flare up.
President Donald Trump: (07:41)
I see that over the weekend, I guess on Friday, there was a record worldwide number of death, worldwide. Because when you watch the news, the local news, and you see it, it’s all about the United States. They never like to talk about what’s going on in the world. But you look at Mexico, Brazil, many countries in Europe, all over Russia, Russia’s got a tremendous problem. What’s going on is terrible. It’s terrible. This is a worldwide problem.
President Donald Trump: (08:15)
We’re helping the world with ventilators. We’re helping a lot of countries. They don’t have ventilators and we’re sending thousands of ventilators to different countries. But, I do want people to understand this is a worldwide problem caused by China, but it’s a worldwide problem. Countries are going through hell. We’re going to give you a lot of briefings in the next week and over the next few weeks as to, I think it’s very important to do it, the vaccines and the therapeutics. I think I’m going to bring some of the great companies that are working, and very successfully in the past, have worked on these things. And they’re going to tell you very specifically what they’re doing and how they’re doing, We think we’re doing very well in that regard. Those two items.
President Donald Trump: (08:59)
I think frankly, therapeutic, I like almost better at this point, you go in and you make people better. Now, we have had some very good luck with remdesivir, that’s been successful and others have been a successful. The plasma has been successful. We’re really coming up with some very good answers, meaning they are. All over the world, we’re working very closely all over the world with the vaccines and the therapeutics. So, we’re going to have some of the heads of these great companies coming in. Johnson and Johnson is doing very well in particular. They seem to be doing very well, but numerous are doing very well. It’s something that I really feel certain. I guess you can use it totally certain, but pretty damn certain that they’re going to have the vaccine. They’re going to have therapeutics and it’s going to start taking place very shortly. That will be a great thing. For the world that will be a great thing.
President Donald Trump: (09:57)
But, this is happening all over the world, not just the United States. And it’s a tough one. It’s very tough. It’s very sad when you see the death. It’s all death that could have been stopped by China. If they wanted to stop it, they could have stopped it. Okay. Thank you very much everybody. [crosstalk 00:10:16]. Thank you.
Speaker 6: (10:14)
All right, guys. Thanks, guys. Guys, let’s go. Come on, guys. Guys, let’s go. John, let’s go. Come on, guys. Guys, let’s go.

How important is a payroll tax cut in [inaudible 00:10:26]?
President Donald Trump: (10:26)
I think it’s very important. I think it’s a very important thing. It’s very good. It’s been proven to be successful. It’s a big saving for the people. It’s a tremendous saving. And I think it’s an incentive for companies to hire their workers back and to keep their workers. The payroll tax cut to me is very important. We’re working on it. And I don’t think there’s too much dispute as to the level of importance, John. It is a very important thing. Okay? That’s one of many elements we’re discussing. We’re discussing probably a total of 10 different elements, but payroll tax cut’s a very important one.
John: (11:06)
[inaudible 00:11:08]?
President Donald Trump: (11:11)
Oh, absolutely. I think, hopefully, we’ll get there, but we’re talking about a lot of things, not just the payroll tax cut.
Speaker 9: (11:16)
So, they’re bringing back the Coronavirus briefing? Do I understand you correctly?
President Donald Trump: (11:22)
Well, we had very successful briefings. I was doing them and we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching. In the history of cable television there’s never been anything like it. And we were doing very well. And I thought it would be automatic and a lot of positive things were happening. And frankly, a lot of the country is doing well. A lot of people don’t say, as you understand, but we have had this big flare up in Florida, Texas, a couple of other places. So, I think what we’re going to do is, I’ll get involved and we’ll start doing briefings, whether it’s this afternoon or tomorrow, probably tomorrow, and I’ll do briefings. And part of the briefing, I think much more so than last time, because last time we were nowhere with vaccines or therapeutics. And, let’s say that ended six weeks ago, we’ll start them again.
President Donald Trump: (12:15)
I think it’s a great way to get information out to the public as to where we are with the vaccines, with the therapeutics, and generally speaking where we are. And so I think we’ll start that probably starting tomorrow. I’ll do it at five o’clock like we were doing. We had a good slot and a lot of people were watching and that’s a good thing. I think that Kaylee will continue hers at 11 o’clock just like they were. I’ll be discussing the, as I call it, the China virus, the China plague, I’ll be discussing it, and I’ll also be discussing perhaps some other things. But, we’re doing very well in so many different ways, but unfortunately this is something that’s very tough, but we’re going to get it solved. I think we’re going to get it solved in numerous ways, but the two best would be vaccines and therapeutics. So we’ll be having that.
Speaker 10: (13:04)
Mr. President, in Portland and other cities that are experiencing violence, there was a report out this morning that you’re considering sending 175 federal troops to these cities to help local law enforcement. Can you fill this in on that?
President Donald Trump: (13:17)
It depends on what your definition of troops is. We’re sending law enforcement. Portland was totally out of control. The Democrats, the liberal Democrats running the place had no idea what they were doing. They were ripping down for 51 days, ripping down that city, destroying the city, looting it. The level of corruption and what was going on there is incredible. And then the governor comes out, “We don’t need any help.”
President Donald Trump: (13:46)
How about Chicago? I read the numbers where many people killed over the weekend. We’re looking at Chicago too. We’re looking at New York. Look at what’s going on. All run by Democrats, all run by very liberal Democrats, all run really by radical left. But, we can’t let this happen to the cities. New York was up 348%, the crime rate, so the governor has to do something about it. And if the governor’s not going to do something about it, we’ll do something about it. But, what’s happening in New York, a place I love, I love New York and look at what’s going on over there. The woman who was shot, because you said, “Could you please not let off firecrackers?” And they turned around and shot her eight times and she died. That’s not our civilization. That’s not about us. And then the police are afraid to do anything. I know New York very well. I know the police very well, New York’s finest. And the fact is, they’re restricted from doing anything. They can’t do anything.
Speaker 10: (14:45)
So what are you planning?
President Donald Trump: (14:46)
I’m going to do something. That I can tell you. Because we’re not going to let New York, and Chicago, and Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Baltimore, and all of these, Oakland is a mess, we’re not going to let this happen in our country. All run by liberal Democrats.
Speaker 10: (15:01)
Get more federal law enforcement to some of these cities?
President Donald Trump: (15:04)
We’re going to have more federal law enforcement. That I can tell you. In Portland, they’ve done a fantastic job. They’ve been there three days and they really have done a fantastic job in a very short period of time. No problem. They grab them, a lot of people in jail. Their leaders, these are anarchists, these are not protesters. People say protesters, these people are anarchists. These are people that hate our country and we’re not going to let it go forward. And I’ll tell you what, the governor, and the mayor, and the senators out there, they’re afraid of these people. That’s the reason they don’t want us to help them. They’re afraid. I really believe they’re actually, maybe even physically afraid of these people, because what they’re doing is incredible.
President Donald Trump: (15:45)
We didn’t just go there. This wasn’t like it started right away. We went there after 51 days, we said, “We can’t let that happen anymore,” but these are anarchists. And the politicians out there, yes they’re weak, but they’re afraid of these people. They’re actually afraid of these people. That’s why they say, “We don’t want the federal government helping.” How about Chicago? Would you say they need help after this weekend? Do you know the numbers? Did you hear the numbers? Many, many shot, many, many killed. I’m not talking about one, two. Was it 18 people killed? I think more than that. And you add it up over the summer. This is worse than Afghanistan by far. This is worse than anything anyone’s ever seen. All run by the same liberal Democrats.
President Donald Trump: (16:38)
And you know what? If Biden got in, that would be true for the country. The whole country would go to hell and we’re not going to let it go to hell. Thank you very much everybody."
"Jul 19, 2020","Chris Wallace: (00:00)
And hello again from Fox News in Washington today from the White House. We’re on the president’s patio, just outside the oval office. President Trump, you’ve agreed to answer all manner of questions, no subject off limits. Thank you, and welcome back to Fox News Sunday.
Donald Trump: (00:15)
Thank you very much.
Chris Wallace: (00:17)
Let’s start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. You still talk about it as, “Burning embers,” but I want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months. As you can see, we hit a peak here in April, 36,000 cases-
Donald Trump: (00:37)
Cases.
Chris Wallace: (00:37)
… a day.
Donald Trump: (00:38)
Yeah, cases.
Chris Wallace: (00:39)
Then it went down and now since June, it has gone up, more than doubled. One day this week, 75,000 new cases.
Donald Trump: (00:48)
That’s right.
Chris Wallace: (00:48)
More than double the old-
Donald Trump: (00:49)
Chris, that’s because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn’t test, you wouldn’t be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down. We tested-
Chris Wallace: (00:59)
But this isn’t burning embers, sir. This is a forest fire.
Donald Trump: (01:01)
No, no. But I don’t say… I say flames. We’ll put out the flames and we’ll put out, in some cases, just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame-like, but it’s going to be under control. And it’s not just this country. It’s many countries. We don’t talk about it in the news. They don’t talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it’s a little ahead of us in that sense. But you take a look, why don’t they talk about Mexico, which is not helping us? And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall because if I didn’t have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.
Chris Wallace: (01:38)
But sir, we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it’s higher than Russia, and the European Union has us on a travel ban.
Donald Trump: (01:50)
Yeah, I think what we’ll do… Well, we have them on a travel ban, too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early. But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it’s the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.
Chris Wallace: (02:04)
That’s not true, sir.
Donald Trump: (02:05)
Well we’re going to take a look.
Chris Wallace: (02:05)
We had 900 deaths on a single day.
Donald Trump: (02:08)
We will take a look.
Chris Wallace: (02:09)
This week-
Donald Trump: (02:10)
Ready?
Chris Wallace: (02:11)
Do you contribute-
Donald Trump: (02:12)
Would you please get me the mortality rate?
Speaker 1: (02:14)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (02:14)
Kaylee’s right here. I heard we had one of the lowest, maybe the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world. Do you have the numbers, please? Because I heard we had the best mortality rate.
Kaylee: (02:23)
This is it. Please speed up [inaudible 00:02:26] countries as Dr. Burks points out. And this is a chart-
Donald Trump: (02:30)
Number one low mortality rate. I hope you show this in there because it shows what fake news is all about. Go ahead.
Chris Wallace: (02:35)
I don’t think I’m fake news, but I will put-
Donald Trump: (02:37)
Today you were.
Chris Wallace: (02:37)
We’ll put our stats on.
Donald Trump: (02:38)
You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world, and we have the best.
Chris Wallace: (02:41)
I said you had the [crosstalk 00:02:42].
Speaker 2: (02:42)
All right, it’s a little complicated, but bear with us. We went with numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which charted the mortality rate for 20 countries hit by the virus. The US ranked seventh, better than the United Kingdom, but worse than Brazil and Russia. The White House went with this chart from the European CDC, which shows Italy and Spain doing worse, but countries like Brazil and South Korea doing better. Other countries doing better, like Russia, aren’t included in the White House chart.
Chris Wallace: (03:11)
California locking down again. Florida, deadliest day of the entire pandemic. Hospitals at capacity a number of places around the country, shortages of testing, shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors. A lot of people say this is because we don’t have a national plan. You talk about states, we don’t have a national plan. Do you take responsibility for that?
Donald Trump: (03:35)
Look, I take responsibility always for everything because it’s ultimately my job to. I have to get everybody in line. Some governors have done well, some governors have done poorly. They’re supposed to have supplies they didn’t have, I supplied everybody. Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas and other areas we’re doing great, but we have a surge in certain areas. But you don’t hear people complaining about ventilators. We’ve got all the ventilators we can use. We’re supplying them to other countries. We go out into parking lots and everything, everybody gets a test. We find if we did half the testing, with all of that being said, I’m glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I’m glad we did what we’re doing, but we have more tests by far than any country in the world.
Chris Wallace: (04:20)
But sir, testing is up 37%.
Donald Trump: (04:24)
Well, that’s good.
Chris Wallace: (04:25)
I understand. Cases are up 194%. It isn’t just that testing has gone up, it’s that the virus has spread. The positivity rate has increased. The virus is worse than it was.
Donald Trump: (04:37)
Many of those cases are young people that would heal in today. They have the sniffles and we put it down as a test. Many of them. Don’t forget, I guess it’s like 99.7%. People are going to get better. And in many cases, they’re going to get better very quickly. We go out and we look, and then on the news, look, if you go back to the news, even your wonderful competitors, you’ll see cases are up. Cases are up. Many of those cases shouldn’t even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world, and we have the most testing. No country has ever done what we’ve done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody’s done is our job on testing, because we’re going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests. You look at other countries, they don’t even do tests. They do tests if somebody walks into the hospital, they’re sick, they’re really sick, they test them then, or they’ll test them in a doctor’s office. But they don’t go around and have massive areas of testing, and we do. And I’m glad we do, but it really skews the numbers.
Chris Wallace: (05:41)
I’m going to do you a favor, because I’m sure a lot of people listening right now are going to say, “Trump, he tries to play it down, he tries to make it not seem as serious as it is.”
Donald Trump: (05:50)
I don’t play it… I’m not [crosstalk 00:05:50]. No, this is very serious.
Chris Wallace: (05:50)
When you see 75,000 cases a day.
Donald Trump: (05:54)
Show me the death chart.
Chris Wallace: (05:55)
Well, I don’t have the death chart.
Donald Trump: (05:57)
Well, the death chart is much more important.
Chris Wallace: (05:59)
I can tell you the death chart is 1, 000 cases a day.
Donald Trump: (06:02)
Excuse me. It’s all too much. It shouldn’t be one case. It came from China, they should have never let it escape, they should have never let it out. But it is what it is. Take a look at Europe, take a look at the numbers in Europe. And by the way, they’re having surges.
Chris Wallace: (06:14)
I can tell you, cases are 6,000 in the whole European Union.
Donald Trump: (06:17)
They don’t test. They don’t test like we do.
Chris Wallace: (06:20)
Is it possible that they don’t have the virus as badly as we do?
Donald Trump: (06:22)
No, it’s possible that they don’t test. That’s what’s possible. We find cases, and many of those cases heal automatically. We’re finding in a way we’re creating trouble. Certainly we’re creating trouble for the fake news to come along and say, “Oh, we have more cases.” Look, we did something that nobody’s ever done. Not only the ventilators where we’re supplying them all over the world. We did a testing program, the likes of which nobody’s ever done before.
Chris Wallace: (06:48)
The head of the CDC, Dr. Redfield, said this on Tuesday.
Dr. Redfield: (06:52)
I do think the fall and the winter of 2020 and 2021 are going to be probably one of the most difficult times that we’ve experienced in American public health.
Chris Wallace: (07:01)
Do you agree with Dr. Redfield?
Donald Trump: (07:02)
I don’t know and I don’t think he knows. I don’t think anybody knows with this. This is a very tricky deal. Everybody thought the summer it would go away and it would come back in the fall. Well, in the summer it came, they used to say the heat was good for it and it really knocks it out. Remember? And then it might come back in the fall. So they got that one wrong. They got a lot wrong. They got a lot wrong, the World Health got a tremendous amount wrong. They basically did whatever China wanted them to. And we’ll save now almost $500 million a year, which is nice. But the World Health got a lot wrong.
Chris Wallace: (07:34)
But this is one of the sharpest criticisms of you.
Donald Trump: (07:37)
I agree.
Chris Wallace: (07:38)
People say that you talk about the world as you’d like to see it rather than follow the science.
Donald Trump: (07:44)
No, I-
Chris Wallace: (07:46)
Let me just ask the question, sir. Why on earth would your administration be involved in a campaign at this point to discredit Dr. Fauci, who is the nation’s top infectious disease expert?
Donald Trump: (07:59)
Because we’re not. If one man from my administration doesn’t like him because he made a few mistakes… Look, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Dr. Fauci told me not to ban China, it would be a big mistake. I did it over and above his recommendation. Dr. Fauci then said, “You saved tens of thousands of lives more than that.” He said, “You saved tens of thousands of lives.” Dr. Fauci’s made some mistakes, but I have a very good… I spoke to him yesterday at length. I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci.
Chris Wallace: (08:28)
But, sir, this weekend your White House put out a series of statements, so-called mistakes that Dr. Fauci had made. One of your closest aides, one of your right-hand men, Daniel Scavino, put out this. Have you seen this? Dr. Faucet. It shows him as a leaker and an alarmest.
Donald Trump: (08:50)
I don’t know that he’s a leaker.
Chris Wallace: (08:51)
Why would he say that?
Donald Trump: (08:52)
He’s a little bit of an alarmest. That’s okay. A little bit of an alarmest.
Chris Wallace: (08:53)
He’s a bit of an alarmest?
Donald Trump: (08:55)
A little bit of an alarmest. Let me just say, Dr. Fauci, at the beginning… And again, I have a great relationship with him. I spoke to him at length yesterday. Dr. Fauci, at the beginning, said, “This will pass. Don’t worry about it. This will pass.” He was wrong. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t ban China. Don’t ban China.” I did. He then admitted that I was right.
Chris Wallace: (09:13)
But you made mistakes, too.
Donald Trump: (09:14)
I guess everybody makes mistakes.
Chris Wallace: (09:15)
I was going to say, you said at one point-
Donald Trump: (09:17)
One person coming in from China and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.
Donald Trump: (09:24)
When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.
Donald Trump: (09:32)
I think we’re going to be very good with the coronavirus. I think that, at some point, that’s going to sort of just disappear, I hope.
Donald Trump: (09:40)
I’ll be right eventually. I will be right eventually.
Chris Wallace: (09:43)
I understand.
Donald Trump: (09:43)
I said it’s going to disappear. I’ll say it again, it’s going to disappear, and I’ll be right.
Chris Wallace: (09:47)
But does that discredit you?
Donald Trump: (09:47)
I don’t think so.
Chris Wallace: (09:48)
Right.
Donald Trump: (09:49)
I don’t think so. You know why it doesn’t discredit me? Because I’ve been right probably more than anybody else.
Chris Wallace: (09:54)
Then there are masks. From the first day that the CDC said that people should wear a mask on April third, you said you weren’t going to. You wore a mask for the first time in public at Walter Reed this weekend. Question, the CDC says, “If everybody wore a mask for four to six weeks, we could get this under control.” Do you regret not wearing a mask in public from the start, and will you consider a national mandate that people need to wear masks?
Donald Trump: (10:24)
No, I want people to have a certain freedom and I don’t believe in that. No. And I don’t agree with the statement that if everybody wore a mask everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said don’t wear a mask. Our surgeon general, terrific guy, said don’t wear a mask. Everybody was saying don’t wear a mask. All of a sudden everybody’s got to wear a mask. And as you know, masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I’m a believer in masks. I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors. Many of the governors are changing, they’re more mask into, they like the concept of masks. But some of them don’t agree. I do say this, schools have to open, young people have to go to school and there’s…
Donald Trump: (11:03)
… Have to open. Young people have to go to school and there’s problems when you don’t go to school too. And there’s going to be a funding problem because we’re not going to fund … When they don’t open their schools, we’re not going to fund them. We’re not going to give them money, if they’re not going to school, if they don’t open their schools.
Chris Wallace: (11:15)
Two points on that. First of all, what the federal government gives is eight percent.
Donald Trump: (11:20)
It’s 10%, and you know what? That’s a lot of money.
Chris Wallace: (11:24)
You know where the money goes? It goes overwhelmingly to disadvantaged kids and children with disabilities.
Donald Trump: (11:31)
Let the schools-
Chris Wallace: (11:31)
Why wouldn’t you send more money, so the schools will be safer.
Donald Trump: (11:34)
Chris, let the schools open. Did you ever see the statistics on young people below the age of 18? The state of New Jersey had thousands of deaths. Of all of these thousands, one person below the age of 18 in the entire state, one person. And that was a person that had, I believe he said diabetes. One person below the age of 18 died in the state of New Jersey during all of this. They had a hard time and they’re doing very well now. So that’s it.
Chris Wallace: (12:04)
The stimulus bill is running out the end of this month.
Donald Trump: (12:07)
Yeah.
Chris Wallace: (12:08)
The Republicans say they want liability limits, which the Democrats don’t like. You say that you want a payroll tax cut, which even some Republicans are cool to.
Donald Trump: (12:19)
Well a lot of Republicans like it, though. You know what I mean?
Chris Wallace: (12:21)
Will you only sign a bill that has those two provisions?
Donald Trump: (12:25)
Well, we’re going to see, but we do need protections because businesses are going to get sued just because somebody walked in. You don’t know where this virus comes from. They’ll sit down at a restaurant, they’ll sue the restaurant, the guy’s out of business.
Chris Wallace: (12:35)
Right.
Donald Trump: (12:35)
So we do need some kind of immunity. You do need it, just like you need immunity for the police. Okay? Whether they like it or not, you need immunity for the police, but they do need a form of immunity. You don’t know if they caught it and nobody’s ever going to be able to prove it one way or the other. You can’t put the people out. Look, the Democrats don’t want to do that because they’re totally captured by the lobby of lawyers. The lawyers lobby is probably the most powerful in the country.
Chris Wallace: (13:01)
What about the payroll tax cut?
Donald Trump: (13:02)
I want to see it. I want to see it.
Chris Wallace: (13:06)
It is in the bill?
Donald Trump: (13:06)
I’ll have to see. But yeah, I would consider not signing it, if we don’t have a payroll tax cut. Yes.
Chris Wallace: (13:12)
Hot enough for you here, Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (13:13)
It’s hot. Well, it’s almost record breaking stuff.
Chris Wallace: (13:18)
We wanted to do it inside. This was your choice.
Donald Trump: (13:20)
And I wanted you to sweat a little bit.
Chris Wallace: (13:22)
Well, we both are. There has been a spike in violent crime in America in recent weeks. We’ve seen deaths up in New York, deaths up in Chicago, shootings. How do you explain it? And what are you going to do about it?
Donald Trump: (13:37)
I explain it very simply by saying, their Democrat run cities, they’re liberally run. They’re stupidly run. We have a forced them in Seattle to end the chop because we were going in that following day. You probably have heard it. We were getting ready to go in. We were all set. And when they heard that we were going, they set their police force.
Chris Wallace: (13:56)
Liberal Democrats have been running cities in this country for decades.
Donald Trump: (14:00)
Poorly.
Chris Wallace: (14:00)
Why is it so bad right now?
Donald Trump: (14:03)
They’ve run them poorly. It was always bad, but now it’s gotten totally out of control. And it’s really because they want to defund the police and Biden wants to defund the police.
Chris Wallace: (14:12)
Sire, he does not.
Donald Trump: (14:13)
Look, he signed a charter with Bernie Sanders. I will get that one. Just like I was right in the mortality rate. Did you read the chart of that he agreed to?
Chris Wallace: (14:24)
It says nothing about defunding the police.
Donald Trump: (14:25)
Oh, really? It says abolish. It says, defund. Let’s go.
Chris Wallace: (14:27)
All right.
Donald Trump: (14:28)
Get me the charter, please.
Chris Wallace: (14:29)
All right to that.
Donald Trump: (14:30)
Chris, you’ve got to start studying for these.
Chris Wallace: (14:31)
He says, defund the police?
Donald Trump: (14:34)
He says, defund the police. They talk about abolishing the police. They talk about illegal aliens pouring-
Chris Wallace: (14:41)
I look forward to seeing that. Meanwhile, the George Floyd murder has re-ignited the issue of racism in policing in this country. I want to give you a couple of statistics. Nationwide, blacks are twice as likely, fewer in absolute numbers, but in terms of per capita. Blacks are twice as likely to be shot and killed by police as whites are. In Minneapolis over the last five years, police use force against blacks at a rate seven times that against whites. Can you understand why blacks would be angry at that?
Donald Trump: (15:13)
Of course, I do. Of course, I do. Many whites are killed, also. You have to say that. I mean, many, many whites are killed. I hate the sound, but this is going on for decades. This is going on for a long time. Long before I got here. If you look at what’s going on in Portland, those are anarchists and we’ve taken a very tough stand. If we didn’t take a stand in Portland, we’ve arrested many of these leaders. If we didn’t take that stand right now, you would have a problem like … They were going to lose Portland. So let’s see what this says here. Prosecution, sanctuary cities, incentivize illegal alien, expand asylum, abolish immigration detention.
Chris Wallace: (15:53)
That’s not-
Donald Trump: (15:53)
Well, no. We’ll find it.
Chris Wallace: (15:55)
Okay.
Donald Trump: (15:55)
This thing is many pages long. End prosecution of illegal border crossers, Support deathly. And these are the worst-[crosstalk 00:16:05]
Chris Wallace: (16:04)
Sir, I’m not disagreeing with you on any of those. I’m disagreeing about defund police.
Chris Wallace: (16:09)
The White House never sent us evidence, the Bernie, Biden platform calls for defunding or abolishing police because there is none. It calls for increased funding for police departments that meet certain standards. Biden has called for redirecting some police funding for related programs like mental health counseling.
Chris Wallace: (16:28)
This week, you said that Black Lives Matter and the Confederate flag are both issues of freedom of speech.
Donald Trump: (16:35)
Yeah.
Chris Wallace: (16:36)
But in the case of the Confederate flag, there are a lot of people who say these were traders who split from this country, fought this country in large part to preserve slavery. Is the Confederate flag offensive?
Donald Trump: (16:53)
It depends on who you’re talking about, when you’re talking about. When people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism. They love their flag. It represents the South. They like the South. People right now like the South. I say it’s freedom of many things, but it’s freedom of speech.
Chris Wallace: (17:09)
So you’re not offended by it?
Donald Trump: (17:10)
Well, I’m not offended either by Black Lives Matter. That’s freedom of speech. And the whole thing with cancel culture. We can’t cancel our whole history. We can’t forget that the North and the South fought. We have to remember that. Otherwise, we’ll end up fighting again. You can’t just cancel all-
Chris Wallace: (17:28)
But let me ask you this one. It gets to be more than just canceled. Well, maybe this is canceled culture. The National Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA. You have threatened to veto it because in the bill, and this is supported by Republicans as well as Democrats that would rename army bases named for Confederate generals. Now, this is a bill that funds military operations. It gives the soldiers a pay raise. You’re going to veto that?
Donald Trump: (17:55)
No, because they’ll get their pay raise. Hey look, don’t tell me this. I got soldiers the biggest pay raises in the history of our military. I got soldiers, brand new equipment, brand new jets, brand new rockets, brand new … Two point five trillion. I did more for the military than any president that’s ever had this office.
Chris Wallace: (18:12)
But you’re going to veto this one?
Donald Trump: (18:12)
Because I think that Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, all of these forts that have been named that way for a long time, decades and decades.
Chris Wallace: (18:21)
But the military says they’re for this.
Donald Trump: (18:23)
Excuse me, excuse me. I don’t care what the military says. I’m supposed to make the decision. Fort Bragg is a big deal. We won two World Wars. Nobody even knows General Bragg. We won two World Wars. Go to that community where Fort Bragg is, in a great state. I love that state. Go to the community. Say, “How do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg?” And then what are we going to name it? You’re going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton, what are you going to name it, Chris? Tell me what you’re going to name it. So there’s a whole thing here. We won two World Wars, two World Wars. Beautiful world Wars that were vicious and horrible. And we won them out of Fort Bragg. We won it out of all these forts and now they want to throw those names away.
Donald Trump: (19:09)
And no, I’m against that. And you know what most other people are. And I don’t believe in polls because I see the fakest polls I’ve ever seen. But that poll is a 64% thing, which actually surprised me. We won World Wars out of these military bases. No, I’m not going to go changing them. I’m not going to go changing them.
Chris Wallace: (19:29)
So you’ll veto that?
Donald Trump: (19:30)
I might. Yeah. I might.
Chris Wallace: (19:32)
At Mount Rushmore on July 3rd. You said that we face a far left fascism in this country. And then you said this.
Donald Trump: (19:39)
Our children are taught in school to hate their own country. And to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but that were villains.
Chris Wallace: (19:52)
You said, “Our children are taught in school to hate our country.” Where do you see that?
Donald Trump: (19:58)
I just look at school. I watch, I read. Look at the stuff. Now they want to change, 1492 Columbus discovered America. We grew up, you grew up, we all did. That’s what we learned. Now, they want to make it the 1619 Project. Where did that come from? What does it represent? I don’t even know.
Chris Wallace: (20:16)
It’s slavery.
Donald Trump: (20:17)
That’s what they’re saying, but they don’t even know it. They just want to make a change. Cancel culture, I hate the term actually, but I use it. Cancel culture.
Chris Wallace: (20:24)
But are they teaching people to hate America?
Donald Trump: (20:25)
I think so. Yeah. I think so. Look at the professors. Look at what’s going on in the colleges, if a conservator goes on a college. And look, we have as many as them. Excuse me, I think to the best of my knowledge was sitting at the White House and the Oval Office is right behind me. We have as many as them.
Chris Wallace: (20:43)
Who’s them?
Donald Trump: (20:44)
The liberal radical left. And I’m not talking all. I think liberal, I could tell you, I like a lot of liberal people. I like a lot of liberal governors, and senators, but Chris, we have a radical left destructive ideology and it’s being taught in our schools and don’t act like you’re surprised to hear this. There are books written about it and we can’t let that go on. We can’t let them change the true meaning of what we’re all about. And that’s what they’re trying to do. And I don’t want it to happen. Not on my watch. It’s not going to happen on my watch.
Chris Wallace: (21:20)
Mr. President, you’ll be happy to know that FOX News has a new poll out today. And you’re going to be the very first person to hear about it. In the national horse race, Joe Biden leads you by eight points, 49% to 41. That’s I think three, four points slimmer than it was a month ago.
Donald Trump: (21:40)
Fake polls.
Chris Wallace: (21:40)
And on the issues, people trust Biden more to handle the coronavirus by 17 points, on race relations by 21 points. And even on the economy, they trust Biden more, by one point. I understand we still have more than a 100 days to this election, but at this point you’re losing.
Donald Trump: (21:59)
First of all, I’m not losing because those are fake polls. They were faking …
Donald Trump: (22:03)
… Losing, because those are fake polls. They were fake in 2016 and now they’re even more fake. The polls were much worse in 2016. They interviewed 22% Republican. Well, how do you do 22% Republican? You see what’s going on. I have other polls that put me leading. And we have polls where I’m leading. I have a poll where we’re leading in every swing state. And I don’t believe that you’re… First of all, the Fox polls, whoever does your Fox polls, they’re among the worst. They got it all wrong in 2016. They’ve been wrong on every poll I’ve ever seen.
Chris Wallace: (22:35)
I must tell you-
Donald Trump: (22:35)
… No, I’m just telling you. And let me ask you this. So on the economy, so I’ve always led on the economy. By a lot.
Chris Wallace: (22:41)
I know, which is why I was surprised by this number.
Donald Trump: (22:42)
Biden can’t put two sentences together. They wheel him out, he goes up, he repeats, they ask him questions, he reads the teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement. You tell me the American people want to have that, in an age where we’re in trouble with other nations that are looking to do numbers on us.
Chris Wallace: (23:00)
So let me ask you a direct question. No, I’m going to ask you a direct question about Joe Biden. Is Joe Biden senile?
Donald Trump: (23:06)
I don’t want to say that. I say he’s not competent to be president. To be president you have to be sharp, and tough and so many other things. That he doesn’t even come out of his basement. They think, this is a great campaign. So he goes in, I’ll then make a speech. It’ll be a great speech. And some young guys start writing, “Vice President Biden said, this, this, this, this.” He didn’t say it. Joe doesn’t know he’s alive. Okay? He doesn’t know he’s alive. Do the American people want that? Number one. Number two, I built the greatest economy ever built anywhere in the world. Not only in this country, anywhere in the world, until we got hit with the China Virus. We got hit with a virus. Shouldn’t have happened. And we had to closeup. We saved millions of lives. Now we’ve opened it up.
Donald Trump: (23:47)
Got to go back to school. We’re open. You got to do things. We had the best job numbers we’ve ever had last month. We should have good ones coming up in two weeks. Look, I built the greatest economy in history. I’m now doing it again. You see the numbers, the numbers are through the roof. The Democrats are purposely keeping their schools closed, keeping their states closed. I called Michigan. I want to have a big rally in Michigan. Do you know we’re not allowed to have a rally in Michigan? Do you know what not allowed to have a rally in Minnesota? Do you know we’re not allowed to have a rally in Nevada? We’re not allowed to have rallies.
Chris Wallace: (24:19)
Well, some people would say [crosstalk 00:24:20].
Donald Trump: (24:20)
In these Democrat run states.
Chris Wallace: (24:21)
Wait a minute. Some people would say that that’s a health risk.
Donald Trump: (24:23)
Some people would say fine. But I guarantee you [crosstalk 00:24:26].
Chris Wallace: (24:26)
We had some issues after Tulsa.
Donald Trump: (24:27)
If everything was gone 100%, they still wouldn’t allow it. They’re not allowing me to do it. So they’re not allowing me to have rallies.
Chris Wallace: (24:35)
But, I got to tell you, if I may, sir, respectfully. In the Fox poll, they asked people who is more competent. Who’s mind is sounder? Biden beats you in that.
Donald Trump: (24:46)
Well, I tell you what. Let’s take a test. Let’s take a test right now. Let’s go down, Joe and I will take a test. Let him take the same test that I took.
Chris Wallace: (24:56)
Incidentally, I took the test too when I heard that you passed it.
Donald Trump: (24:59)
Yeah. How did you do?
Chris Wallace: (25:00)
It’s not the hardest test.
Donald Trump: (25:01)
No.
Chris Wallace: (25:01)
It’s a picture and it says, “What’s that?” And it’s an elephant.
Donald Trump: (25:04)
No, no, no. See, that’s all misrepresentation.
Chris Wallace: (25:07)
That’s what it was on the web.
Donald Trump: (25:07)
It’s all misrepresentation. Because yes, the first few questions are easy. But I’ll bet you couldn’t even answer the last five questions. I’ll bet you couldn’t. They get very hard, the last five questions.
Chris Wallace: (25:16)
Well, one of them was count back from 100 by seven.
Donald Trump: (25:19)
And let me tell you, you couldn’t answer many of the questions.
Chris Wallace: (25:26)
All right. What’s the questions?
Donald Trump: (25:26)
I’d get you the test. I’d like to give it, but I guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions.
Chris Wallace: (25:31)
Okay.
Donald Trump: (25:32)
Okay? And I answered all 35 questions correctly.
Chris Wallace: (25:35)
You talk about how you’re winning, campaigns going well. Why did you replace Brad Parscale? Isn’t that-
Donald Trump: (25:42)
… Because he’s a great digital guy. We all like him a lot. But I have somebody that was involved. They were all on the 2016 campaign.
Chris Wallace: (25:52)
Right.
Donald Trump: (25:52)
And we have Corey and we have all the people. And actually, Steve Bannon’s been much better not being involved. He says, “The greatest president ever.” I mean, he’s saying things that I said, “Let’s keep Steve out there. He’s doing a good job.” But, they’re all involved. If Joe Biden got in, first of all, he won’t call the shots. The people, the radical left people that surround him will call. Religion will be gone. Okay? Life, you could forget about that. The whole question of life.
Chris Wallace: (26:19)
When you say life, you mean abortion?
Donald Trump: (26:21)
Absolutely. 100%. That whole question, which is a very… It’s always been a 50/50 thing.
Chris Wallace: (26:27)
I understand.
Donald Trump: (26:27)
It’s actually trending a little bit more toward one side.
Chris Wallace: (26:30)
When you say religion is going to be gone, what does that mean?
Donald Trump: (26:33)
Look at what they’re doing to the churches. They won’t let the churches even open if they want to stand in a field six feet apart. We’ve had churches that wanted to stand in fields, six feet apart. There has never been an administration that’s done so much as I have. From tax cuts, to regulation cuts, to rebuilding the military, to getting choice for the vets. Nobody’s done the things I’ve done. Nobody. In three and a half years, no other president has been able to do what I’ve done.
Chris Wallace: (27:01)
You’re running in large part on the economy. You built it once. Now we have the coronavirus. You’re going to build it again? And in fact, you had great jobs numbers in May. You had solid jobs numbers in June. But I want you to look at some projections. The Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the unemployment rate at the end of the year will be 10.5%. JP Morgan says in the fourth quarter, GDP will contract by 6.2%. With states now rolling back some of the reopening-
Donald Trump: (27:33)
… On purpose.
Chris Wallace: (27:34)
Well, there are a lot of Republican states that are doing it, like Texas.
Donald Trump: (27:39)
There’ll be open very soon.
Chris Wallace: (27:40)
Let me just ask my question.
Donald Trump: (27:41)
There’s no reason for California to be doing what they’re doing.
Chris Wallace: (27:44)
All right.
Donald Trump: (27:44)
Except for November 3rd.
Chris Wallace: (27:46)
With the states shutting back their reopening, in a lot of cases new lock downs, won’t the economy still be a problem for you on election day?
Donald Trump: (27:55)
I think so. I think the economy is expanding and growing beautifully. Now, the Democrats want to keep it closed as long as possible because they think that’s good for election. But I think the economy is doing very well. Now, we’re coming back. And we’re coming back at a level that nobody would have thought possible. And by the way, take a look at another… I mean, a gauge, whether you like it or not, the stock market. The stock market, NASDAQ hit its all time high two weeks ago. And it’s beaten it 14 different times. Okay? The stock market, Dow, et cetera, is 1,000 points away from its all time high. Meaning, very close. We’re going to have a stock market, perhaps on November 3rd, that’s the highest in history.
Chris Wallace: (28:40)
I want to talk to you about Obamacare. Since the pandemic hit, millions of people have lost their jobs and thereby lost their health insurance. And almost a half a million have signed up for Obamacare. Your administration just announced that you’re signing on to a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.
Donald Trump: (28:56)
And replace it.
Chris Wallace: (28:58)
Why does it make sense to overturn Obamacare with which people now are relying on? Democrats are going to say, “The man who’s wanted to kill Obamacare is going to take away the protection for preexisting conditions.”
Donald Trump: (29:09)
First of all, we got rid of the individual mandate. Preexisting conditions will always be taken care of by me and Republicans. 100%.
Chris Wallace: (29:16)
But you’ve been in the office three and a half years. You don’t have a plan.
Donald Trump: (29:18)
We haven’t had… Excuse me. You heard me yesterday. We’re signing a healthcare plan within two weeks. A full and complete health care plan that the Supreme Court decision on DACA gave me the right to do. So we’re going to solve… We’re going to sign an immigration plan, a healthcare plan and various other plans. And nobody will have done what I’m doing in the next four weeks. The Supreme Court gave the President of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had, by approving, by doing what they did, their decision on DACA. And DACA is going to be taken care of also. But we’re getting rid of it because we’re going to replace it with something much better. But we got rid of already, which was most of Obamacare, the individual mandate. And that I’ve already won on. And we won also on the Supreme Court. But the decision by the Supreme Court on DACA allows me to do things on immigration, on healthcare, on other things that we’ve never done before. And you’re going to find it to be a very exciting two weeks.
Chris Wallace: (30:22)
Your niece, Mary Trump, has written a book about you and your family. And one of her main points is that she says your dad, Fred Trump Sr., damaged the whole family. And here’s what she says about what you learned from your father.
Mary Trump: (30:39)
He learned to become the killer, you mentioned. The man who needs to succeed at all costs. Who will do anything to get attention, financial rewards and to win.
Chris Wallace: (31:00)
Do you see any truth in that?
Donald Trump: (31:02)
My father liked to win. My father was a very good man. He was a strong man. It’s disgraceful that she said that. She was not exactly a family favorite. We didn’t have a lot of respect or like for her. I would have never said that, except she writes a book that’s so stupid and so vicious. And it’s a lie. My father was a great, wonderful man.
Chris Wallace: (31:21)
Let me just ask you this question-
Donald Trump: (31:22)
… But, this is not a person that I spent very much time with. Very little time. And now I’m glad.
Chris Wallace: (31:29)
You’ve developed a pretty thick skin over the years from decades of attacks in New York tabloids, now from the press here and your political opponents here in Washington. But even for Donald Trump, does it hurt you at all to be attacked in such personal terms by a member of your own family?
Donald Trump: (31:49)
It hurts me more about attacking my father, not being kind to my mother. I have a mother who was like a Saint. She was incredible. She was an incredible woman. And she was nasty even to my mother. She’s a very scarred person. She was not much of a family person. But look, let me just tell you, my father was… I think he was the most solid person I’ve ever met. And he was a very good person. He was a very, very good person. He was strong, but he was good.
Donald Trump: (32:18)
For her to say the kind of things, a psychopath, that he was a psychopath. Anybody that knew Fred Trump would call him a psychopath. And you know what, if he was, I would tell you. And I would say, “You know, Chris, I was with my father and it was impossible.” My father was… He was tough. He was tough on me. He was tough on all of the kids. But tough in a solid sense, in a really good sense. For her to say, I think the word she used was psychopath. What a disgrace. She ought to be ashamed of itself. That book is a lie.
Chris Wallace: (32:48)
Some people were surprised when you agreed to this interview, to sit down with me.
Donald Trump: (32:54)
What are you going to ask?
Chris Wallace: (32:55)
Especially because of some of the mean tweets that you’ve said about me. ” Mike Wallace wannabe. Nasty and obnoxious.” I will tell you-
Chris Wallace: (33:03)
… “Mike Wallace wannabe … nasty and obnoxious.” I will tell you, after that one, my son, Peter, whom you’ve met, called and he said, “Nasty? No. Obnoxious? Maybe.” But here’s the question. One of your beefs seems to be that I put Democrats on the show, and I ask them questions, and I guess the question I have is don’t you understand it’s my job to put Democrats on as well as Republicans, and to ask them probing questions, just like I ask Republicans?
Donald Trump: (33:28)
I’m not a big fan of Fox. I’ll be honest with you. They’ve changed a lot since Roger Ailes, and I watch people like Swalwell, who I don’t even know. He goes on the show. He got less than 1%. All of a sudden, he’s on being interviewed for endless [crosstalk 00:33:42].
Chris Wallace: (33:42)
Yeah, but I interviewed Nancy …
Donald Trump: (33:43)
I don’t know him.
Chris Wallace: (33:43)
Wait, I interviewed-
Donald Trump: (33:45)
I watched the nastiest people.
Chris Wallace: (33:47)
I interviewed, you sent one tweet after I interviewed Nancy Pelosi, and in the interview, I asked her specifically about the fact in February, you were in Chinatown pitching tourism while the virus was spreading.
Chris Wallace: (33:59)
If the president underplayed the threat in the early days, Speaker Pelosi, didn’t you as well?
Chris Wallace: (34:06)
Isn’t that legitimate to talk to the Speaker of the House?
Donald Trump: (34:09)
I would just say that … Look, I know you very well. I respect you a lot. I respect your father a lot. I thought he was one of the most talented journalists there are, and you likewise are a very talented person. I do think this. I think you are very … I think you are toward the Democrat side, which is okay. I mean, it’s okay.
Chris Wallace: (34:26)
It’s not … Watch the James Comey interview I did in December. 17 significant errors in the FISA process, and you say that it was handled in a thoughtful and appropriate way.
James Comey: (34:39)
Yeah, he’s right. I was wrong.
Chris Wallace: (34:40)
But you make it sound like you’re a bystander, an eyewitness. You were the director of the FBI while a lot of this was going on, sir.
James Comey: (34:47)
Sure. I’m responsible for … That’s why I’m telling you I was wrong. I was overconfident as director in our procedures.
Chris Wallace: (34:54)
You couldn’t do as tough an interview with Comey. I’d like to think I treat everybody the same.
Donald Trump: (34:59)
It just seems to me that you are very prone to be nice to the Democrats, and maybe I’m wrong about that, Chris, but it’s an honor to be with you. It’s fine. I love it. I love that it’s close to a hundred degrees out today.
Chris Wallace: (35:09)
Your choice again.
Donald Trump: (35:10)
Yeah, I know, that’s okay.
Chris Wallace: (35:11)
I’m not saying you’re going to lose. I am not saying that. We saw how you turned it around last time.
Donald Trump: (35:16)
I don’t think I’m going to lose at all.
Chris Wallace: (35:17)
But if you did, how crushing would it be to you?
Donald Trump: (35:20)
First of all, let me just tell you something. I know everyone wants to know that, because they’d love to see me lose finally.
Chris Wallace: (35:24)
I’m not … I am not saying that at all.
Donald Trump: (35:26)
You know how many times I’ve been written off? Do you know how many times I’ve been written off?
Chris Wallace: (35:29)
I’ve done some of it myself, sir.
Donald Trump: (35:30)
My whole life.
Chris Wallace: (35:31)
I’m not doing it this time.
Donald Trump: (35:32)
Don’t do it, because it would be bad.
Chris Wallace: (35:34)
But how crushing would it be?
Donald Trump: (35:35)
And you know why I won’t lose? Because the country, in the end, they’re not going to have a man who’s shot. He’s shot. He’s mentally shot. Let him come out of his basement, go around. I’ll make four, five speeches a day. I’ll be interviewed by you. I’ll be interviewed by the worst killers that hate my guts. They hate my guts. There’s nothing they can ask me that I won’t give them a proper answer to. Some people will like it. Some people won’t like it.
Chris Wallace: (36:01)
I agree with that.
Donald Trump: (36:02)
But, look.
Chris Wallace: (36:03)
You answer the questions.
Donald Trump: (36:04)
Let Biden sit through an interview like this. He’ll be on the ground crying for Mommy. He’ll say, “Mommy, Mommy, please take me home.”
Chris Wallace: (36:10)
Well, we’ve asked him for an interview, sir.
Donald Trump: (36:12)
He can’t do an interview. He’s incompetent. There’s a number you don’t mention. It’s called the enthusiasm number. The enthusiasm for Trump is through the roof, even higher …
Chris Wallace: (36:22)
I have mentioned it.
Donald Trump: (36:22)
… even higher than last time. The enthusiasm for Biden is nonexistent. Everyone knows he’s shot.
Chris Wallace: (36:27)
But the enthusiasm against you is high.
Donald Trump: (36:30)
Well, that’s okay. That’s his only shot. I mean, that’s his only shot.
Chris Wallace: (36:32)
Right.
Donald Trump: (36:32)
I agree. Those people know I’m doing a good job, but there’s something in my personality that they don’t like, because look, nobody’s done what I’ve done. Biden wants to come in and ruin our country, triple your taxes. He wants to do things. He wants to add regulations that I’ve all cut, and we still have regulation, a lot of regulation, but I’ve cut it down to a level that nobody ever thought possible. He will destroy this country, but it won’t be him. It will be the radical left, the same type ideology that took over Venezuela, one of the richest countries in the world. They now have no water. They have no food, and they have no medicine. That’s going to happen here if he wins.
Chris Wallace: (37:12)
Two final questions. In general, not talking about November, are you a good loser?
Donald Trump: (37:19)
I’m not a good loser. I don’t like to lose. I don’t lose too often. I don’t like to lose.
Chris Wallace: (37:24)
But are you gracious?
Donald Trump: (37:25)
You don’t know until you see. It depends. I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election, I really do.
Chris Wallace: (37:32)
Are you suggesting that you might not accept the results of the election?
Donald Trump: (37:35)
I have to see. Look, Hillary Clinton asked me the same thing.
Chris Wallace: (37:38)
No, I asked you the same thing at the debate.
Donald Trump: (37:40)
No, no. But-
Chris Wallace: (37:40)
There is a tradition in this country, in fact, one of the prides of this country, is the peaceful transition of power, and that no matter how hard fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign, that the loser concedes to the winner. Not saying that you’re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner, and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country. Are you saying you’re not prepared now to commit to that principle?
Donald Trump: (38:05)
What I’m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I’ll keep you in suspense.
Hillary Clinton: (38:09)
Well, Chris …
Donald Trump: (38:11)
And you know what? She’s the one that never accepted it.
Chris Wallace: (38:14)
I agree.
Donald Trump: (38:14)
She never accepted her loss, and she looks like a fool.
Chris Wallace: (38:17)
But can you give a direct answer, you will accept the election?
Donald Trump: (38:19)
I have to see. Look, I have to see. No, I’m not going to just say yes. I’m not going to say [inaudible 00:38:24], and I didn’t last time either.
Chris Wallace: (38:25)
Whether it’s in 2021 or 2025, how will you regard your years as president of the United States?
Donald Trump: (38:33)
I think I was very unfairly treated from before I even won. I was under investigation by a bunch of thieves, crooks. It was an illegal investigation. Russia, Russia, Russia.
Chris Wallace: (38:42)
But what about the good parts, sir?
Donald Trump: (38:44)
No, no. I want to go this. I have done more than any president in history in the first three and a half years, and I’ve done it suffering through investigations where people have been, General Flynn, where people have been so unfairly treated. The Russia hoax, it was all a hoax. The Mueller scam, it was all a scam. It was all false. I made a bad decision on one bad decision, Jeff Sessions, and now I feel good, because he lost overwhelmingly in the great state of Alabama. Here’s the bottom line. I’ve been very unfairly treated, and I don’t say that as paranoid. I’ve been very … Everybody says it. It’s going to be interesting to see what happens, but there’s tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was.
Donald Trump: (39:25)
President Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. It’s never happened in history. If it were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years right now. That would be Comey. That would be Brennan. That would be all of this, the two lovers, Strzok and Page. They would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail. It would’ve started two years ago, and they’d be there for 50 years. The fact is, they illegally spied on my campaign. Let’s see what happens. Despite that, I did more than any president in history in the first three and a half years.
Chris Wallace: (40:03)
Mr. President, thank you. Thanks for talking with us.
Donald Trump: (40:06)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Jul 16, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:17)
Hello everybody, thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Please. That’s a nice crowd on a nice cool day. It’s beautiful though. Might be hot but it’s beautiful. We’re here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. These oppressive burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people, slashing take home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas. Millions and millions and millions, it never ended. Nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the American worker and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history by far. No other administration has done anywhere near. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:24)
At the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise, for every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. We not only met that ambitious goal which at the time people said was impossible, we vastly exceeded it. For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. Been an incredible achievement. As you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic regulatory burden Americans have forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100.00 every single year and we’re going up from that number. We’re going up from that number. Think of that. $3,100.00 per household. Joining us today is Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you Mike. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Wilbur, thank you very much. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, thank you, thank you [inaudible 00:02:43]. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Thank you Alex. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Thank you Elaine. We had a great day in Georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobody’s ever seen before. EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, thank you Andrew, thank you very much. OMB acting director Russ Vought, thank you Russ, and Small Business administrator, I love her name, Jovita Carranza. Jovita, thank you, thank you, and CMS administrator Seema Verma, thank you Seema. Great people. Those are great people, they’re doing an incredible job. I also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. Thank you very much and thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. What we have achieved together is truly without precedent, never happened before. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the federal register. That’s why nothing got done. Under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations, more than any other president by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or in one case, more than eight years. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations, a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300.00 per year. Think of that, the average American $ 2,300.00 regulation, hitting low-income Americans by far the hardest.
Donald Trump: (04:38)
These regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on African-American communities. By contrast our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans. In addition to saving every family more than $3,000.00 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my council of economic advisors estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200.00 per vehicle and I think we’re going to get that up to $3,500.00 per vehicle. It’s very exciting, and by the way, the vehicles will be better, they’ll be stronger, and they’ll be safer. Our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband internet services and some home energy bills will be really historically cut. It’s actually amazing, as well as historically low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices, you look today, I think it was $1.99. At the same time, we saved our oil companies. We are now the largest since we’ve been here, the largest energy source in the world. Nobody’s even close so it’s great but we saved them. They had a hard time a number of months ago and frankly for a long time but we’ve saved them. $1.99 they were telling me, in some cases lower than that.
Donald Trump: (06:06)
We’re bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, shower heads and faucets. So shower heads, you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer, you take a shower longer. Because my hair, I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers, you didn’t have any water so the people that do the dishes, you press it and it goes again and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you’ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water and in many places, in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don’t know what to do with it. It’s called rain. They don’t have a problem. And old-fashioned, incandescent light bulbs, I brought them back, I brought them back. They have two nice qualities, they’re cheaper and they’re better. They look better, they make you look so much better, that’s important to all of us, but they’re better and much cheaper and they were mandated out, legislated out, and we brought them back and they’re selling like hot cakes.
Donald Trump: (07:32)
We stopped the egregious abuse of the Clean Water Act which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. When I signed that legislation I had many farmers and construction people standing behind me. People that haven’t cried since they were babies, some of them never even when they were a baby and they were crying. Many people were crying. We gave them back their life. They took away their land, they took away their rights, they took away their life. By reigning in EPA overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of insuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. Our air now and our water is as clean as it’s been in the last four decades. Yesterday our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of America’s badly broken infrastructure approval process. It was totally out of control.
Donald Trump: (08:34)
Instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, we’re cutting the federal permitting timeline, it’s already been done, to a maximum of two years or less, in some cases even less than one year. It’s possible that it won’t qualify, it’s possible that it won’t be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case at least in a period of a year or two, we’ll raise the hand and you won’t make it, but most projects will make it but you won’t go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. There are many horror stories that we could relate.
Donald Trump: (09:11)
We’re reclaiming America’s proud heritage as a nation of builders. My administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers. In our battle against the China virus, these actions saved countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. That means ventilators like nobody’s ever seen before. Probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievement since World War II. We’re now making ventilators for countries all over the world.
Donald Trump: (09:44)
Medicine, accelerating the delivery of life-saving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. We’re doing fantastically well on that. That will be for another time, another meeting, but we are doing on therapeutics and vaccines incredibly well. No administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. When you think of it, we are all set up, that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic, and we’re set up militarily, we’re going to be delivering it in record time. It’s all set to move. We put an investment upfront and we have logistical people, generals, great people. They’re going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it and we’ve made tremendous progress, you’ve been reading about it.
Donald Trump: (10:36)
In total we’ve taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the China virus. This includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great auto workers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators so we’ve done over 100,000 in 100 days. Think of that, and we didn’t have ventilators, we weren’t set up for ventilators. We became a country that’s making a lot of them. Helping so many others. Countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. They’re complex, they’re expensive, they’re big. Very, very, very tough to do and we’ve saved a lot of lives. There’s never been a person in our country, even though we started with almost nothing, I say the cupboard was bare when we took over, we started with nothing. There’s never been a person in our country, even though we had just absolutely … We were going on empty, never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. Think of that. Not one person, as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. Take a long time to get them done. Not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. We made telemedicine, thank you. Great job. Great … Really a great job. The people here, they get no credit for it. I don’t want any credit, they should get
Donald Trump: (12:03)
People here, they get no credit for it, “I don’t want any credit.” They should get the credit, but they get no credit, but we’ve done a great job helping so many other countries now. We made telemedicine available to all American patients, and allowed doctors to work across state lines. I will tell you, the telemedicine is something that’s really gone up by thousands, and thousands of percentage points, of percent, because what happened is, people that wouldn’t even think of using telemedicine all of a sudden started using it, and it’s really turned out to be good. Really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems, so that’s something that’s been great advancement.
Donald Trump: (12:40)
Furthermore, I’ve ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. Vice President Pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. Over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment, and to employment, and including a state that I love very much. I have a little history in that state, the great state of Alaska. Thank you very much, governor, for being here, Mike Dunleavy. Mike, thank you very much
Donald Trump: (13:20)
In Idaho, governor Brad Little who is here today with us as well set a new record for regulatory relief. Good job, Brad. Good, good governor, great governor. Two great governors. The American people know best how to run their own lives. They don’t need Washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. With each regulation we cut, we’re not only returning the money, and the power to our citizens, we are draining the Washington swamp, and they’re not happy about it. I can tell you that. I think you know that.
Donald Trump: (14:04)
The swamp was deep. I just didn’t know how deep, deeper than I thought. Joining us today are a few of the countless Americans who are personally benefiting from our pro-worker reforms. Joe Cambria owns Cambria Truck Center in New Jersey, good state, New Jersey, and it’s been really something that he’s seen firsthand, how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. Joe, please come up, and say a few words. Thank you, Joe.
Joe Cambria: (14:35)
Thank you Mr. President. Our company, Cambria Truck Center, [inaudible 00:14:48] since 1969, when my grandfather, uncle, and father started the business. In the past three and a half years, the Trump administration has kept its promise to right size regulations. I want to thank you for that, President Trump. Regulatory reform in the energy sector creates jobs, reduces costs for our communities, and puts trucks to work. Streamlined permitting, and creating an environment that allows for efficient construction, and infrastructure repair, and development has the same effect. As a result of these regulatory reforms, our industry has seen record sales of heavy duty trucks, which has been a boon to dealerships like ours, as well as the environment.
Joe Cambria: (15:37)
When new trucks replace older models, there is an environmental benefit. Current power trains have near zero emissions today, and we’re going to electric, as well as increased safety, like shorter stopping distances, and collision avoidance technology, safer on the road. It has also been nice to hear, “Made in the USA.” again. Bringing manufacturing back to our shores helps our industry, and our entire country. In short, when we cut red tape, we create an economy that is responsible and sensible. We as Americans all win. Thank you, President Trump.
Donald Trump: (16:16)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Good job, good job. That was easy. Wasn’t it? Thank you very much, great job. Dr. Amy Johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural Virginia. Amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded health care and telehealth has been for you, and your patients. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Dr. Amy Johnson: (16:43)
Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Amy Johnson, and I’m from Bedford, Virginia. Telehealth deregulation has been of substantial benefit to my colleagues and I over recent months during the COVID-19 crisis. Prior to COVID restrictions, our small local hospital that had limited access to specialty services, used telehealth for neurological, mental health, and palliative care consults. However, telehealth was not something that was used within our primary care setting. Since the deregulation of telehealth restrictions, and expansion of guidelines through CMS, we’ve had the opportunity to integrate video and audio visits as part of our patient care experience.
Dr. Amy Johnson: (17:28)
During the COVID crisis, there were days when almost all of my visits were done via telehealth. This allowed me to continue to care for my patients, including those that were the most vulnerable without risking exposure to illness by bringing them into the office setting. Since we’ve gone back to a more traditional model, we’ve continued to offer telehealth visits, which are a valuable option for home, health, and hospice patients, patients with limited mobility, and patients that remain at high risk. As a farm safety specialist, I can see the use of telehealth expanding to offer more services to our farming population and rural Americans including much needed mental health services, which are unfortunately very sparse.
Dr. Amy Johnson: (18:12)
In addition, access to primary care, and to specialty services can be improved in medically underserved areas with deregulation, and the use of telehealth services by healthcare providers increasing the use of preventative healthcare modalities, allowing for more intensive management of patients with chronic diseases, and decreasing healthcare disparities. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (18:38)
Thank you very much, great job, thank you. So, that’s been a great help to you, telehealth, it’s been an incredible thing. Great job. Thank you very much. Jim Shelton is a rancher from Arizona who was crushed by the Obama, Biden administration’s ridiculous Waters of the United States rule. It’s been a catastrophic rule, but it’s gone now, which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land or a lake. Jim, please come up, and tell us of your experience, which I know wasn’t a good one, but it’s a good one now, please.
Jim Shelton: (19:20)
I appreciate the invitation President Trump to be here, and I appreciate the opportunity to thank you for the deregulation in every area, including the Waters of the United States, cutting the red tape, setting us free as private property owners. Thank you. Our ranch has approximately a hundred dry washes flowing across it. These are little washes with no water. The Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency who wrote the Obama 2015 regulations ruled that any dry wash that had more than 12 inches of sand in the bottom became a water of the United States. Hence, we were subject to regulations and oversight from Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. It as outrageous.
Jim Shelton: (20:46)
I believe that the 2015 rules and regulations were overreaching, caused red tape, and threatened me, and other farmers, ranchers, businessmen, and land owners with the possibility of going to jail, and facing huge fines. Thank you Mr. President for the navigable water protection rule that you’ve promulgated. It has set us free. That heavy hand of government is no longer on our shoulders. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (21:31)
Thank you Jim. Thank you very much, thank you Jim.
Donald Trump: (21:39)
That was my honor Jim, and thank you very much. It’s terrible, that you had to suffer for so long, and they took your property away from you, and you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. You’ll take care of it better, so we don’t have to worry about that. Thank you very much, beautifully said, thank you. I want to just, as president say that I will always fight to defend your rights, and your freedoms. I Will fight very hard for your rights, and your freedoms. The [inaudible 00:22:12] wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and reimpose these disasters regulations. They want to take what we’ve taken off, Jim, and they want to put them back on, and I guess they can do that.
Donald Trump: (22:26)
You’ll fight him for a little while, but eventually, you’ll lose, and they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of Washington red tape, like we had before I got here. We must never return to the days of soul crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality right out of our people, and thoroughly crippled our nation’s prized competitive edge. It’s what we have. We have great, great people. The greatest people in the world. Our entire economy, and our very way of life are threatened by Biden’s plans to transform our nation, and subjugate our communities through the blunt force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven’t even seen yet.
Donald Trump: (23:17)
Do you think that was bad? You haven’t even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past. Under the Unity platform, Joe Biden published with socialist Bernie Sanders, they are proposing, and this is all in writing. It’s done. They agreed. They are proposing to reenter the job killing unfair Paris Climate Accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars, trillions and trillions of dollars, and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. Not surprising to you, China will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, so will Russia, so will many other countries. They proposed to mandate…
Donald Trump: (24:03)
… other countries. They propose to mandate net zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of home ownership out of reach for millions. Destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home, I’m somebody that’s built many homes, many buildings. If you take a look at this, it doesn’t look good. You still have to sell, right? You still have to sell, but they’ve put it out of reach from a cost standpoint, totally out of reach. It’s not practical, it’s not good and it doesn’t work.
Donald Trump: (24:37)
They want to eliminate carbon from the US energy industry, which means abolishing all American oil, clean coal and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this federally mandated shut down would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. Millions and millions of jobs would go, thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that you’ve never seen. Companies would be disappearing, left, and right, just like they did with NAFTA, which we terminated for the USMCA, which is another beauty that we’ve done, not for now, but another great beauty.
Donald Trump: (25:40)
But thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. Under this dismal future energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans and the American dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. The Democrats in DC have been in one, two at a much higher level abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. They’re absolutely determined to eliminate single family zoning, to destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in Minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise.
Donald Trump: (26:33)
Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left, want to significantly multiply what they’re doing now. And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they want to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement, while at same time destroying our great suburbs. The suburb destruction will end with us. Next week, I will be discussing the AFFH rule, AFFH rule, a disaster. And our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by Washington Democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed that don’t care. People have worked all their lives to get into a community and now they’re going to watch it go to hell, not going to happen, not while I’m here.
Donald Trump: (27:44)
The Biden/Bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail, think of that. Think of that bail, no problem, they killed somebody let them out. Take a look at what’s happening, crime in New York City up 368% from just a short while ago. They got rid of a lot of police and they’re in the process of doing it, a billion dollars. They probably want to abolish… it’s not even believable. When I first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didn’t think it was real, you didn’t think it was believable. Just like the Green New Deal, how crazy is that? But they’re actually trying to put it into play, it’ll mean the end of this country.
Donald Trump: (28:34)
So by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures. They want to get rid of prisons, they don’t think anybody should go to prison. Setting loose violent criminals, appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in Philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go in many cases immediately and making our wonderful cops, our great, great police, cops, subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime.
Donald Trump: (29:18)
Unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that don’t know what they’re doing. We believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. Our regulatory reforms are vital, not only to the success of our economy but the strength of our democracy and the survival of Liberty itself. My administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of Washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the United States. We are putting our faith in the workers who power our country, the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. The American people are the ones who made our nation great and together we will make it greater by far than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (31:04)
We must have said something right, I guess we said it absolutely right. It’s about our country, it’s about our country. We want to be strong. We want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement and that’s taking place in the areas that we’re responsible for. We want others to call us for help, there’s nothing wrong. Let Chicago call, let Seattle call, we where going into Seattle, all set to go and then they did it themselves. They heard we were coming in and the hands went up, they gave up. And it’s so terrible when you see what’s happening. Minneapolis, we said, “Get the Guard in there.” Three nights, “Get the Guard in, get the guard.” We got the Guard in. The National Guard, they’ve done a fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (31:53)
As soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. You saw that, right? After four days of horror, it wasn’t the police’s fault in any of these places, they were told to leave. The police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. They were told to leave, but you so what happened. Minneapolis, grab your gun and run. That’s not what they wanted to do. But the National Guard came in and we did a great job. No problem, after that, did you notice?
Donald Trump: (32:27)
We just passed a Statues and Monument executive order and they were going well, now you see that beautiful… Look at it right there it’s so beautiful, the Washington Monument. If they had their choice they’d take it down, and I guarantee you they’d rename it. They want to rename it, they want George Washington out. They won Thomas Jefferson out. They want Abraham Lincoln out. They want abolitionists out. They don’t know what they want, they just want to destroy our country. We’re not going to let it happen, we’re not letting it happen. So I’d now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence to say a few words. Thank you, Mike. Thank you.
Jim Shelton: (33:19)
Thank you Mr. President. It’s a privilege to be with you today. Thank you for bringing together all these great hardworking Americans, to be able to hear their stories, to be able to reflect on the fact that before the coronavirus hit our country. Thanks to your leadership, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. In three short years, Mr. President, you kept your promise to the American people. We cut taxes across the board. You fought for free and fair trade. You unleashed American energy and you rolled back regulations to help all Americans. And after 40 years of over regulation, Mr. President, you delivered four years of regulatory freedom.
Jim Shelton: (34:14)
And in our first three years, the results were extraordinary, businesses large and small created 7 million new jobs, wages rose at their fastest pace. In more than 10 years, 2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, 7 million Americans lifted off of food stamps and the highest median income in the history of our country.
Jim Shelton: (34:34)
And Mr. President, as you just reflected a centerpiece of that was lifting red tape off the American people and American free enterprise. I remember those days in the campaign four years ago when you promised that for every new regulation, we’d eliminate two rules off the federal register. But as you just said, Mr. President, for every new regulation put on the books, you actually repealed nearly eight regulations off of the American people and the American economy. And this president has already signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history.
Jim Shelton: (35:15)
They tell us that we’ve saved $220 billion in our economy, and as you said, more than $3,100 for every American household. And beyond all of that, that regulatory form now has America as the largest supplier of oil and natural gas in the world and a net export of energy for the first time in 75 years, that’s what your deregulation agenda delivered.
Jim Shelton: (35:40)
And today, Mr. President, as we continue to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, at your direction we’re ensuring that our States and our hospitals and our extraordinary health care workers have not only the supplies they need, but the freedom and the flexibility to give every American the same level of care that each one of us would want a family member to have. And as we meet this moment…
Jim Shelton: (36:03)
…most would want a family member to have. And as we meet this moment, in this pandemic, we’re also opening up America again. It’s extraordinary to think Mr. President, at the height of this pandemic, our economy had lost 22 million jobs, but because of the strong foundation that you laid of less taxes and less regulation, in two short months, May and June saw record breaking job creation. We’ve already added 7 million jobs back to the American economy, and we’re just getting started.
Jim Shelton: (36:36)
This record job growth, Mr. President is attribute to the resilience of the American people, strength their character. It’s a resilience to your leadership, to the agenda that you advanced in our first three years. But as you said, Mr. President, it’s also a tribute to governors across the country we not only supported your agenda, but also, in more than 30 states, governors actually delivered on that same agenda of less taxes and less regulation. And while I’ve been leading the White House Coronavirus Task Force, it’s also been my honor, Mr. President, to lead the governor’s initiative on regulatory innovation and to work with these extraordinary governors. The truth is, because of your leadership and example of governors across the country have been reducing the burden of regulations at the state level. And that’s what’s contributed to the strong foundation on which we are standing and the American recovery has already begun.
Jim Shelton: (37:28)
Fortunately, as you mentioned, we have two of those great governors with us today. The first is a governor who in his very first year in office, cut or simplified more than 75% of his state’s regulations and cut the administrative code by 20%. Would you all join me in welcoming Idaho’s great governor, Brad Little to tell us Idaho’s story of deregulation.
Governor Brad Little: (37:55)
Thank you, Mr. Vice president. Mr. President, it’s a great honor to be here. As the Vice President alluded to, our route to rebound is dependent upon the red truck, not the blue truck. What we did in Idaho, where we had the third lowest unemployment, the third fastest income growth of any of the states, particularly for those at the lower end of the income was to match up with your regulatory reform and make more opportunities available, whether it be the spouse of a military veteran that came there, that wanted to have their license in their home state transferred, which today I can proudly say takes us one half day to get that done, so that those people can be there. Whether it’s a small business that wants to break through and remove the regulatory friction that existed there before.
Governor Brad Little: (38:50)
But as this economy changed as a result of what’s taken place, you have to free up all Americans to have that freedom to create a new opportunity. One of the things that we did that we heard about from the good doctor was tele-health. Between CMS, the department and what we did in Idaho, we increased tele-health availability in Idaho by 4000%. Idaho is a rural state. Idaho is a state where accessibility and the cost of healthcare is always an issue. It’s the combination and the teamwork of your administration and what we’ve done that made that available to where we will rebound in Idaho. And thank you very much, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (39:32)
Thank you very much, Brad. Thank you. Thank you, Brad.
Jim Shelton: (39:38)
Thank you, Governor Little. And finally, Mr. President allow me to introduce the governor who told us in December, when you kicked off the governor’s initiative on regulatory innovation, that in his first year in office, his administration modified or rolled back 239 different regulations in over 100 professions. He is making sure that Alaska is open for business and prospering with less taxes and less regulation. Join me in welcoming Alaska’s great governor, Mike Dunleavy.
Joe Cambria: (40:15)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. And thank you Mr. President for having us here today. What you’ve done here for us, for governors and the people of this great country and Alaska, we are part of the great country by the way, Mr. President, you know that.
Donald Trump: (40:28)
You are.
Joe Cambria: (40:29)
The president has been up in our state, we’ve met at least eight times. And when he stops over in Anchorage, Alaska on his trips, he always wants to meet. And the first thing he says is, “Can we meet the troops? And what do you need in the state of Alaska?” This is a small state population-wise, way up North, but this President sees the importance of that state and its people. This is really about hope, Mr. President, restoring hope and opportunity. And this is what you’ve done. This is really about the art of the possibility. As the previous Governor Little said, what you’ve done is historic, and it’s going to continue to be historic.
Joe Cambria: (41:06)
In Alaska, for example, we have communities that are 500, 600 miles off the road system. The tele-health regulations that have been put in place now are not only going to be good for medicine, but they’re going to save lives as a result of the work that you and your team have done. We look at our resource development, we look at businesses, small and big, and you’ve restored. You’ve renewed hope that it is possible to achieve the American dream. These regulations over the past 40 years have really, in many respects, killed the American dream. As you said, strangled the American dream. And in the end, really what this comes down to is how does it impact the individual American, the individual Alaska, in my case.
Joe Cambria: (41:53)
I want to tell you, what you’ve done is, when the landowner goes and decides that they want to do a little landscaping on their property, do they have to look over their shoulder and wonder if big government is watching them? Can they do what they need to do on their private property? You’ve restored the hope that they can, that they can realize the American dream. And this goes for our corporations. This goes for our entities, our nonprofit entities, this goes for our native corporations in Alaska. What you’ve done is restored hope and opportunity. And we’re looking forward to a more years of this opportunity, Mr. President so thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (42:26)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mike. Thank you. We have many exciting things that we’ll be announcing over the next eight weeks I would say. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible and things that we’re going to get done and we have gotten done. We’ve started in most cases, but it’s going to be a very exciting eight weeks. A eight weeks, I think Mike, we can honestly say nobody’s ever going to see eight weeks like we’re going to have, because we really have. We’re taking on immigration, taking on education, we’re taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress. They’ve been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years, wasn’t happening.
Donald Trump: (43:24)
But you’ll see levels of detail and you’ll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn’t have in this country. We’re going to get things done. We’re going to get things done that they’ve wanted to see done for a long, long time. I think we’ll start sometime on Tuesday. We’ll be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but that’s one of many, many different plans. Then we’re going into the immigration, the world of immigration. The world of education. We’re going into the world of healthcare, very complete healthcare. And we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss, but cutting of regulation has been really something that I felt we could do and we could do fairly easily. Nothing’s easy in this country.
Donald Trump: (44:18)
We had statutory requirements where we’d do phase one and then we’d have to wait 90 days, we’d do phase two and we’d have to wait 60 days. We do phase three and we said, let’s do phase four, “Sir, I’m sorry, you have to wait one year.” But we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do or even close on deregulation. And these trucks, this really is a great, a great little example. I don’t know who thought of this idea, but it’s actually quite simple and quite good. Is that Brooke? Quite simple and quite good. I don’t love having that big sucker hanging over my head. I want to get out of here as fast as possible, but I do want to thank you all incredible people. You’ve done an incredible job. And to the speakers, please. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brad."
"Jul 15, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:23)
Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Great honor. Please, thank you. Sit down, please. It’s great to be with you. Great company and wonderful location. Quick flight. It’s in and out, but we have some big things to say. Carol, I want to thank you also for doing such an incredible job at this company. I look at your numbers and I’m very jealous. A lot of people are very jealous. But I’m delighted to be back in Atlanta, Georgia, special place. The hometown of one of the most amazing companies on earth, UPS. They never fail. The dedicated men and women of UPS are an inspiration to us all. In the face of every challenge, you always come through for your fellow citizens. Would you say that’s correct? I say it’s correct.
Donald Trump: (01:22)
Let me start by expressing my gratitude to every driver, worker, and employee who has contributed to this great success and continue to deliver for America throughout our battle against the China virus, it goes by many different names, about 21 that I can figure. We maybe we’ll use a different one every time we hit it, but whatever it is, it was a terrible thing and it could have been stopped and it should have been stopped right where it started in China. Together, we will defeat this virus and emerge stronger than ever before. We’re here today to celebrate a historic breakthrough that will transform the lives of workers and families all across our nation.
Donald Trump: (02:10)
For decades, the single biggest obstacle to building a modern transportation system has been the mountains and mountains of bureaucratic red tape in Washington, DC. Before I took off, it’s reviews for highways ballooned to an average of nearly 750 pages in length, and they were the good ones, they were the short ones. And I know because I was in business for a long time and I had to go through a process that was so ridiculous. It was so ridiculous. We went through a process for building buildings usually, it would take forever. By the time you start building, the market changed. You said, “The market was good when we started, now the market’s lousy.” So you’d say, “To hell with it. We won’t build.”
Donald Trump: (02:54)
Sometimes you’d start building and you’d say, “That was a mistake.” But we went through years and years of litigation and tumult, and it was just not good, but you’d go through it. To an even greater extent, the maze like approval process represented lobbyists that were very rich. They were making a lot of money. I remember I’d go up to Albany, New York and I’d see my lobbyists up there. I’d say, “What are you doing here?” I knew what they were doing. They were trying to make it more difficult so you had to hire them for more and more work, spend millions and millions of dollars for nothing. But too often, they caused massive delays on top of everything else. And that way they got their fees over a longer period of time.
Donald Trump: (03:37)
It’s one of the reasons why, for example, the average Atlanta driver spends an incredible 77 hours in traffic during a short period of time. But all of that ends today. We’re doing something very dramatic. We just completed an unprecedented, I don’t want to say it’s absolutely unprecedented, top to bottom overhaul should have been done years ago of the infrastructure approval process. This approval process that has cost trillions of dollars over the years for our country and delays like you wouldn’t believe. This is a truly historic breakthrough, which means better roads, bridges, tunnels, and highways for every UPS driver and every citizen all across our land.
Donald Trump: (04:29)
Together we’re reclaiming America’s proud heritage as a nation of builders and a nation that can get things done. Because with these horrible roadblocks that were put in front of us, you couldn’t get it done. No matter how good you were, you couldn’t get it done. You’d wait and wait. You’d go to the next step. You say you can’t start the next step until you finish the first. Joining us for this special occasion are Council of Environmental Quality chairman, Mary Neumayr. Where’s Mary? Mary. Thank you, Mary. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mary. Good. Secretary of transportation, a very special woman, a great woman, somebody that has done an incredible job, Elaine Chao. Elaine.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
And she was very much instrumental in getting this done. And when Elaine speaks, we all listen, but she was very much instrumental. Secretary of agriculture, a man who has done a fantastic job for our farmers and ranchers, Sonny Perdue. Sonny. I learned more about farming from Sonny Purdue than all of these consultants that came in. I learned more in a half an hour from that man right there. We had a great call today with the farmers too. Great call. They’re doing very well. A lot of good things have happened, right Sonny? A lot of things have happened. They were targeted by China. They were targeted by others. We just signed the USMCA, which is phenomenal for our country and our farmers. Got rid of one of the worst trade deals in history, NAFTA.
Donald Trump: (06:07)
One of the worst trade deals ever, how anybody could have signed it, but worse, how anybody could have let it run for 25 years or whatever it was. They just took advantage of us. We had 60,000 empty plants and factories in our country by the time that mess got finished. So we just signed a great deal, USMCA. It’s the largest trade deal ever made, Mexico, Canada, the largest ever made. I know Sonny would like me to thank the UPS, all of the drivers and workers for all of the help in delivering nearly 30 million meals to rural children throughout the country for our Meals-to-You program. Meals-to-You, you know what that is? Meals-to-You. You do, right?
Donald Trump: (06:53)
We’re also pleased to be joined by a great senator, somebody that’s done a phenomenal job. And I can tell you, look, he’s a friend of mine, so I’m a little prejudiced, but he’s a man that’s respected by everybody on both sides of the US Senate. He works hard. He loves your state. And I always say, does David get the kind of recognition that he deserves? Because he is a very, very special man. David Perdue, where is David? David, thank you. And a woman who’s come in and done a great job. And she’s been so supportive of me and the agenda, and a good person, a good woman with her husband who’s a terrific man, Senator Kelly Loeffler. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kelly. Great job, Kelly.
Donald Trump: (07:46)
And warriors, these are warriors. These people fought for us through thick and thin, through very, very unfair territory. We were treated terribly and they came in and they turned out to be tougher than the other side by a lot. And I just want to introduce representatives Rick Allen, Rick. Thanks, Rick. The great Buddy Carter. Buddy. An incredible spokesman, an incredible man and friend, Doug Collins. Doug. Thank you, Doug. Great job, Doug. Drew Ferguson. Drew. Thank you very much, Drew. Jody Hice. Jody. Thank you, Jody. Great job, Jody. And Barry Loudermilk. Barry, thank you very much. And also two people, friends of mine. They’ll be there soon in my opinion because they have to, because we need all the help we can get in Washington.
Donald Trump: (08:45)
Karen Handel. Karen, thank you very much. Thank you, Karen. And Rich McCormick. Rich, thank you. They’ll be there soon I hope. I hope. We need them. We need them. Get them in there. Thank you as well to a man who I became very good friends with, a man who was running against somebody that was unbeatable, running against a superstar. I said, “Oh, she’s a superstar. Wow.” Can you beat superstars? I don’t think so, but he figured out how to be a superstar. And I don’t know if she’s still a superstar, Brian. I’m not sure. I’m not sure. I don’t think so. I don’t know. Superstars don’t lose. Do they? Governor Brian Kemp. I’ll tell you, what a warrior he is. He’s tough. He’s tough and he’s done a great job.
Donald Trump: (09:40)
You’ve done a great job in every aspect of running this incredible state. And I’ve always been there for you. He was saying when we met at the plane, “Everything we’ve needed in Georgia, you’ve been there for,” and that’s right. That’s right. Perhaps more important than Brian, however, right? Far more important is Georgia first lady, Marty Kemp. Thank you very much, Marty. And watch please those mail-in ballots. You’re going to watch that for me because they have a lot of problems all over the country. They just had Paterson, New Jersey where massive percentages of the vote was a fraud. Mail-in ballots, be careful. Be careful. They would understand because they deliver.
Donald Trump: (10:24)
In fact, I’m going to have to be very nice to UPS. UPS, I love you, Carol, wherever you are, Carol. I love you, Carol. Now it’s very bad what’s going on with mail-in ballots. Okay? As differentiated from absentee ballots where you have to go and you go through a process because you can’t be there for some reason, but the mail-in ballots is going to be, they’re going to be rigged. They’re going to be a terrible situation. And you have to be careful in Georgia, but you have to be careful everywhere where they’re doing it. We went through a First World War and a Second World War and people went to vote. Now they’re saying, “Let’s use this-”
Donald Trump: (11:03)
Or people went to vote. Now they’re saying let’s use this as a chance not to vote. And there’s been tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption on mail-in ballots. So absentee ballot, great, mail-in ballot, absolutely no good. It makes no sense. A governor sends out millions of ballots all over the place. They don’t know where they’re going. They’re going to wherever. I have a friend who got one for his daughter, another one for his daughter, and then a second one for the first daughter. They didn’t know what to do with them. I had another friend, a really wonderful guy who lost his son seven years ago, Robert, his son, Robert, and his son was sent a mail-in ballot. He called me, he said, “What do I do? I just got a mail-in ballot for Robert? Robert died seven years ago.” So it’s a terrible situation if they decide to use it. And we’ll see what happens. There’s a lot of litigation, a lot of court cases right now.
Donald Trump: (11:57)
And it makes sense. Just think of it. Millions of ballots. In California, they’re sending out millions of ballots. They don’t even know who. Maybe they know too well who they’re sending them to. And maybe it’s the people that don’t get it. Maybe it’s an area of Republicans or Democrats that don’t happen to get any ballots. We’ve had a lot of problems. Just take a look at what’s gone on over the last month and take a look at Patterson, New Jersey. Small city in New Jersey. I think they said something like 20% of the ballots were corrupted or something happened with them. 20%. And even in the 2016 election, 1% are in question. But I don’t want to talk about that one because I won. So I don’t want anyone going back and looking, all right? I’m not going to talk about 2016. That was the greatest election.
Donald Trump: (12:45)
And now we have to do something very important. We have to keep it going or this country will be in big, big trouble. I want to thank also for being here, Georgia Attorney General, Chris Carr. You’re the one Chris. Watch that Chris, will you? Williams. You’re going to watch that, Chris, please, okay? You got to speak to the man that handles it. You know what I’m talking about. You got to do it. Thank you, Chris. It’s in good hands. Superintendent Richard Woods. Richard, thank you very much. Thank you. And members of the Georgia Public Service Commission and the State Senate and House Transportation Committee. We’ve got a lot of politicians in this room. And really good luck to Karen and to Rich. Go out and go get them. You’re great people. Today’s action is part of my administration’s fierce commitment to slashing the web of needless bureaucracy that is holding back our citizens. I’ve been wanting to do this from day one. Then we started on day one, literally on day one, but it takes a long time. You have statutory requirements. You have a lot of different roadblocks, even to changing it. But the change you’ll be hearing about in a minute, and it’s one of the biggest things we can be doing for our country. The last administration increased the Federal Register by 16,000 pages of job-killing regulations. Under my administration, we have cut the Federal Register by nearly 25,000 pages, more than any president in history, whether it’s four years, eight years or one case more.
Donald Trump: (14:17)
And we, frankly, this I would think is maybe the biggest of all. We did the U.S. Waters. You saw that? The U.S. Waters Act? That was a big one. That was a big one. I thought I was going to take a lot of heat when I did that, and instead, it was just the opposite. People came up, grown men that had never cried even when they were a baby, they were standing behind me when I signed that bill at the White House, and they were crying. They were crying because we gave their life back to them. That took their life away. It took their livelihood away. It was a big, big moment, but this is a big moment today, too. Probably, possibly equally as big.
Donald Trump: (14:56)
Today’s action completely modernizes the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. We are cutting the federal permitting timeline from a staggering 10 years, 15 years, 18 years, 21 years. You know the story. You’ve seen it. Projects that start out, a young guy heads the project. By the time it gets approved or disapproved, in many cases, disapproved, usually disapproved, he’s getting ready to retire. Say, “What do you do for your life?” “I worked on one project. We didn’t get it through in the end.” Now we won’t get certain projects through for environmental reasons. They have to be environmentally sound, but you know what? We’re going to know in a year. We’re going to know in a year and a half. We’re not going to know in 20 years.
Donald Trump: (15:46)
So we’re cutting the federal permitting timeline for a major project from up to 20 years or more, hard to believe, down to two years or less. So we have it down to about two years right now, Elaine, and I think two years or less, and our goal is one year. And you may get disapproved. They may vote at the end. They didn’t like something environmentally or safety-wise, and I’m all for that. But you’re not going to devote a lifetime to doing a project that doesn’t get approved or that gets approved. And oftentimes when it gets approved, it comes in at 10, 20, 30 times the cost.
Donald Trump: (16:24)
There’s a highway in a certain state, short road, not even a highway, I guess, more of a roadway. And they put it in, it was a straight line from point to point. By the time they finished it 18 years later, it was this. It cost tens of times, it cost many, many, many times more than the original. It’s a dangerous roadway because there’s turns. You got to be in good shape. You got to be wide awake to make those turns. You got to see those things. You have to see the guard rails, boom. They had a simple straight roadway and now they build it and they end up… It took 17 years to get it approved. Ended up costing many, many times what the original estimates were, and it’s no good. It’s not good.
Donald Trump: (17:08)
Under the last administration, a mere 7% of reviews for federal highways were processed within two years. Now what we’re doing is, the two years won’t be the exception, it will be the rule. So what we’re doing is we’re going to have that coming down at a much steeper rate. This will reduce approval times for highways alone by at least 70%. But the 70% is a very unambitious number because the number’s going to be actually much lower than that. At the heart of the reforms is the One Federal Decision Policy. It really spells it out when you hear that name. One Federal Decision. Before, applicants for infrastructure permits were forced to spend years and years navigating a labyrinth of federal agencies, and every single one had the power to stop a project.
Donald Trump: (18:04)
Anytime you went to an agency, they had a power to stop it. And it would stop the project. Not only stop it, right in its tracks, it would stop it. With our reforms, it would be one quick and fair decision. We’re going to give every project a clear answer, yes or no. Yes or no. The two-year process where just to submit is two years is not acceptable. It’s going to be a very quick yes or no after study, but the studies are going to go quickly, and they’re going to go simultaneously.
Donald Trump: (18:37)
So if you’re in numerous agencies, you’re all going at the same time instead of waiting for one, for two, for three. And oftentimes you’d go through one, it would take you six months, and then you have to wait 90 days, and then you have a review period, and then you start the second one. And now you go for another four months, and then you wait 90 days, and you have a review period. And sometimes you had to go through nine, 10, 12 different agencies. So even if you did absolute rapid, it was many, many years before you could even think about starting it.
Donald Trump: (19:10)
We have up here, by the way, that’s a chart of the old system and the new system. And I think the new system is better. I think it’s better not only in time. I think it’s better in terms of the process. And I think it’s better in terms of the importance from an environmental and a safety standpoint. But take a look at that. This is what you had to go through. In fact, it was much more dramatic when I first came up with this about a year ago. We took that and we rolled it out. It was so dramatic, and it just kept going and going. So the difference is that, and many of those steps you had to wait before you could even think about going to the next one, and you had to get full approvals. Any one of those colors, where there was a problem or a rejection, meant it was dead. And now you go through this very simple but very comprehensive solution. That’s a beautiful thing. Especially if you understand construction and building and other things beyond building like I do.
Donald Trump: (20:14)
At the same time, we’ll maintain America’s Gold Standard Environmental Protections. The United States will continue to have among the very cleanest air and cleanest water on earth, which we do now. We have the cleanest that we’ve ever had, ever meaning, I guess, in the last 40 years. I assume that 200 years ago was cleaner. I can imagine it was very clean a couple of hundred years ago, Brian, right?
Donald Trump: (20:37)
That’s why I’m very careful with the fake news media, because if I say that, “We have the cleanest water we’ve ever had,” they said, “What about 200 years ago before anybody touched the lake? When the Lake was a beautiful virgin lake. Nobody ever touched it.” They said, “Yeah, they got me on that one,” don’t they, huh? So now I’ve become extremely careful. So I say probably they’re talking about 35, 40 years, something like that. If it’s any different from that, media, we will… Look at all those people back there. Any different than that, we will report to you. We will make an amendment. We’ll never make a correction because I don’t like doing that.
Donald Trump: (21:16)
One of the first projects accelerated by these reforms will be the planned expansion of I-75 right here in Georgia. That’s in honor of your wife, in honor of Marty. Okay? That’s in honor of Marty. They’ve been looking to do that for many years, right? But the governor is going to get it done. This expansion will add 77 new lane miles of commercial vehicles like those driven by UPS, saving drivers countless hundreds of hours a year. With us today is Julian [Palk 00:22:03], a teamster, I know the teamsters very well, at UPS who drives this route often. Julian, please come up and tell your story, please. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (22:07)
Thanks, Julian.
Julian Polk: (22:13)
Good afternoon. Hi, my name is Julian Polk. It’s a great honor to be in front of you. I’m especially grateful for my wife being here with me today of 14 years. I spent the first 16 years of my career driving a package car going from house to house. But in my last three years, I’ve been in the big rigs, mostly on 75. And throughout 75, we have approximately 765 trucks in Metro, Atlanta. 64 of those travel from McDonough to Macon, Georgia, which is about a hundred miles round trip. With the congestion and all of that, it kind of makes it to where it’s hard to get there and create all the time commits. Every time I’ve loaded my truck, whether it was medical equipment, a gift to someone’s loved one, that time in transit was very important.
Julian Polk: (23:12)
With this infrastructure, it’s very important to me and all of my fellow UPSers because the investment in our roads and bridges help reduce congestion and open up the bottlenecks, which makes it easier to get the packages to where they need to go. More importantly, safe for drivers like myself, because we all know the most important stop of the day is when I get back home to her and my two beautiful kids. Thank you. 14 years ago at my local hub in Forest Park, with the support of my management team, I started the corporate health and safety process. Throughout that team, we were able to lower the accidents and injuries, which we know accidents on the road slows down time in transit. Since then, we’ve stopped all of that or most of it. I’d like to close by saying thank you to my wife for being here, to everyone that has supported me, especially my division manager, Tom Rosilio. He has supported me in my career and for the great opportunity to be here today.
Donald Trump: (24:22)
Fantastic job. Thank you, Julian. But Julian, it looks like you’re attributing a lot of your success to your wife. Is that a correct statement?
Julian Polk: (24:32)
Absolutely.
Donald Trump: (24:32)
Would you please stand up? So lovely. Thank you. That’s great. Great job. You’re proud of the job he just did, I think. Huh? Pretty good. He’ll be running for office next week. Watch. Great job, Julian. Thank you. I’d like to invite UPS’ vice president of corporate transportation, Bill Taylor, up to say a few words. Please, Bill.
Donald Trump: (25:07)
Thank you, Bill. Thank you very much.
Bill Taylor: (25:10)
Good afternoon. Now, thank you for visiting the UPS gateway President Trump. Thank you very much. I am so proud to be a 37 year veteran of this great company. I started my UPS career as a part time hourly employee when I was still in school, back in 1983. When I graduated from college, I went into management and throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work in our airline, in our freight transportation operations, and also in our package delivery operations throughout the United States. I’m now preparing to retire. When I think about UPS, all of us at UPS and is a great example. All of us that UPS worked through some very tough times through our careers, whether it’s hurricanes and natural disasters or some type of national event like 9/11, and now COVID-19, but all of us that UPS also look at that as a great opportunity to serve this great country and help bring the country through and remedy those tough situations.
Bill Taylor: (26:10)
You look at project Airbridge under the Trump administration and working directly with FEMA. Another great example. From a UPS standpoint, we are all tremendously proud to help deliver life saving supplies, wherever and whenever they are needed. From an infrastructure standpoint, I know firsthand that improvements in our infrastructure will be a tremendous benefit to not only our customers, but also the communities that we serve. But when I think about UPS, I know how strong our technology is. I know how strong our flexible multimodal transportation network is. And I know all UPSers are dedicated to making a difference and helping bring America forward. As I think about the ending my career, I am very grateful to retire with a strong pension plan. I hope the same for all essential workers who have a pension plan currently hung up, that they can enjoy the same when their work is over. Thank you, UPS for a wonderful career and the great opportunity to work with so many wonderful people through the years to help make a difference. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (27:24)
Thank you very much, Bill and good luck. Carol, I don’t think I’d let him retire. He’s got about 30 years left in him at UPS. Can’t believe you’re retiring. That’s terrible. You want to retire or do you want to stay because they’ll renew you for 25 years. You’ve got it. You’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. Thank you, Bill. Really great job. Here as well as the commissioner of Georgia Department of Transportation, Russell McMurry. Russell, please come up and say a few words. Thank you.
Russell McMurry: (28:03)
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, it was an honor for me to meet with you in Washington, DC at the USDOT with Secretary Elaine Chao and some other state DOT commissioners from around the nation. For us to share with you this long burdensome, often bureaucratic process and you sat and listened to us with great detail that day. At the end of that meeting, too, I might add that the President told us, the DOT commissioners there in the room that he was going to streamline the environmental process, cut the red tape and make sure that the environment is protected, number one. Today is a full circle day for me, Mr. President, that here we are today with the President and the Trump administration rolling out yet another, not the first, but another environmental process improvement that will make life much easier for people like us at the Department’s of Transportation’s across the nation to deliver infrastructure projects like the I-75 commercial vehicle lanes to move that freight out of Savannah to Atlanta and beyond, while providing a safe corridor for the many families that travel on I-75.
Russell McMurry: (29:18)
Now, I certainly want to acknowledge someone else that is laser focused on streamlining government and cutting red tape and that’s our governor, Brian Kemp. Governor, I appreciate your focus to transportation and infrastructure. It certainly makes my life a lot easier so thank you. Now, finally, I’d just like to recognize somebody else and the President acknowledged her earlier, but the leadership exemplified by Secretary Elaine Chao at the USDOT is exceptional. We have never experienced the kind of cooperation … We at the Georgia’s DOT has never experienced this type of cooperation from your administration, Mr. President, that we enjoyed today. Thank you for your leadership and thank you for the partnership you share, not only with Georgia, but all the states. Mr. President, thank you for making this happen. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (30:17)
And Russell said that so well because there have been many steps that we’ve made over the course of the last three years that allowed us to get to this big, giant step. This is a big deal, and this is front page all over this country. Frankly, nobody realizes what it means other than the people that are in this room and others that do what you do, but the fact is, this is something that nobody thought was possible. But it was all those little steps, Russell, that allowed us to get to this step bureaucratically and then every other way. Thank you very much and you’ve done a great job. Appreciate it. We’re also joined by Janell King, a small business owner here in Atlanta. Janell, please come up and say a few words, please.
Donald Trump: (31:03)
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Janell King: (31:13)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Governor Kemp. And thank you UPS for delivering all my shoes on time. I am Janell King. Together, my husband Kelvin King, and I he’s the one that really goes through all of this. I serve as VP of External Affairs with Osprey Management, which is such an honor. We have 10 employees, by which one of them received their United States citizenship this morning, so that’s awesome. We have over 150 subcontractors and we have a number of projects that are taking place throughout the state. Our ability to harness opportunities and supply our clients with on time projects promptly is extremely important. Several have proposed fantastic ideas and aid to developing new forms of commuting. Red tape and restrictions in place have hindered these ideas and due to extensive permitting and impact studies that increase timelines.
Janell King: (32:15)
Well, Mr. President, you have shown what leadership can do when you reform the old way of doing things. Infrastructure reform and building new roads faster will not only help our company to achieve our project goals, but they will help the entire state, both economically and socially. I would like to personally thank you for placing the needs of the constituents in the forefront of your list and addressing our infrastructure concerns and our governor and first lady for working along with you until we can get this done and to our senators; Senator David Perdue and Senator Kelly Leffler for always being available as well. Thank you so much.
Donald Trump: (32:51)
Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. And look how proud your husband is of you. He had that camera up. That camera wasn’t moving down, I’ll tell you. He captured every word…
Donald Trump: (33:03)
Camera up, that camera wasn’t moving down, I tell you. He captured every word. That’s great. Beautiful family. Thank you very much. One of the things I’ll tell you that the Governor and I are working on, a couple of projects that are going to be big surprises for you, big ones, big projects that you’ve been talking about for 20 years I guess in one case. So we’ll get them done. I’m sure we’ll get them done. And I want to thank you all. Great presentations. Thank you all very much.
Donald Trump: (33:26)
My administration is also moving full speed ahead on improving the Port of Savannah, which is now the largest agriculture exporting port in the entire United States, largest in the country. As many of you know, this project faced 20 years of unnecessary delays. This has been going on for years. When they came to me and the Governor said, “Can you help us with this? I said, “We’ll help you with it. What’s the story?” It’s been going on for years and years. They’ve been talking about it. Nothing ever happened. It was also eight years of additional bureaucratic reviews, just reviews. This isn’t like, “Oh, gee, let’s start digging.” This is paperwork. People made a lot of money. It’s a terrible thing. It just gets caught up like so many other places. But it’s all ending now.
Donald Trump: (34:11)
Bureaucratic reviews under the Obama-Biden administration have been a disaster. And they got worse. But I’m proud to report that for three straight years under my administration, we’ve delivered full funding for the Port of Savannah and we’re on track to complete the project in a very short period of time. It’s going to be complete. In honor of the Governor. In honor of the Governor and Marty. Good. Congratulations. That was a great job. They’ve been fighting for that one for a long time. You got it done. We want a governor that gets it done. Even though he calls me all the time, “Can we get it done?” I wish he wouldn’t call so much. But you know, that’s the sign of a good governor, right? When you think, right? Stand up, please. That’s a sign of a governor. I like the ones that don’t call, Brian, where they just leave me alone. But their project never happens. Great job you do, great job.
Donald Trump: (35:09)
We want the United States to compete and win in the 21st century. And that means we will not allow our nation to be hamstrung by wasteful Washington regulations. We’re the nation that built the Golden Gate Bridge in four years, the Hoover Dam in five years. And a lot of people don’t understand this, but it’s so true, we built the Empire State Building and less than a year. Can you imagine that? The Biden administration, our past vice president, opposes, think of this, all of our permitting reforms, and wants to increase the length of the permitting process. Think of this, this is in his Bernie Sanders deal. Biden is happy to tie up projects in red tape, and we want to get things built. But they want to increase the length. So they want to increase it from that to much longer. Unbelievable.
Donald Trump: (36:02)
Biden wants to massively re-regulate the energy economy, rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, which would kill our energy totally. And you’d have to close 25% of your businesses and kill oil and gas development. They still haven’t explained what they’re going to do to power our great plants and factories. But at some point, I’m sure they will. We’ll learn that from AOC, who’s in charge of energy. She’s in charge, along with Bernie. It’s AOC and Bernie are in charge of energy. I don’t think Texas is too happy about that. What do you think? You think we’ll call up the governor, Governor Abbott, great governor. We’ll ask, “How do you like that Governor?” I didn’t want to waste the phone call because I would know how he felt.
Donald Trump: (36:46)
And Biden wants to hold hostage billions in federal surface transportation grants for states and localities, unless the states and local suburban communities abolish single family zoning rules. So they want low income housing to be built in communities that frankly, they don’t want it. They don’t want it. Hasn’t worked out. And we’re terminating that as you know. I announced it two weeks ago. We’re going to be eliminating that rule. It’s a crazy rule and it’s very unfair to a lot of people. A lot of people are very unhappy.
Donald Trump: (37:19)
It should not take 10 years or more just to get approval for a simple stretch of road. Special interests in Washington will never begin, they will never begin to let you breathe. That’s not their business. Their business is the opposite. And we will do vetoes wherever necessary in order to make sure everything happens and happens quickly. We’re not giving a veto for one thing, America’s future. There will never be a veto for America’s future. So my goal, my mission, and my commitment to each of you is very simple. America’s infrastructure will be the envy of the entire world as it was many, many years ago. We built the interstate highway system during the Eisenhower administration, a long time ago. And since then it’s gotten worse and worse and worse and more bureaucratic and more bureaucratic. And now we’re freeing up and we’re going back probably to around 1952. We’re going back to a long time ago. And again, you do have to get permits. We want safety. We want to be totally involved with the environment. We want our environment to be better than it would be the other way, the long way. But you’re going to get your answers quickly. One way or the other, you’re going to get those answers very quickly. And if the answer is a big, beautiful, yes, you’re going to start construction immediately. You’re not going to wait around for 10, 12, and 20 years.
Donald Trump: (38:47)
Our bridges, tunnels, freeways, and airports will no longer be the site of shame, but they’ll be a source of pride. From coast to coast, town to town, we’re constructing new roads, railways, runways, and waterways. You know, we had many cases where they’ll get federal funding to build a highway, then it’ll take them forever to get the approval. And by the time they have it approved, they need 10 times more money. They come back to the federal government. And the government would usually turn them down. They’d say that wasn’t the deal. But sometimes they’d just paid 10 times more. We’re not going to do that anymore.
Donald Trump: (39:22)
We’re linking our cities with gleaming highways and blazing fast broadwalk. And if you think, when you look at the farmers of this country, what they’ve gone through with the broadband, broadband is so bad in the middle section, that beautiful middle section of our country, our farmers, our ranches are hurt very badly. So we’re getting fast broadband networks, and we’re carving them out, and towering, beautiful new monuments to American greatness. And that’s what they will be. But our farmers have to be thought of also. Nobody thought of our farmers. Our farmers are incredible and they’re doing an incredible job, doing an incredible job. So for the farmers out there, broadband, here we come. Broadband, they’ve been trying to get it for a long time, many years.
Donald Trump: (40:13)
Together, we’re building our incredible future with American hands, American heart, and American steel. As your president, I’m more determined than ever that America’s infrastructure will be second to none. And in Georgia, you’re going to have an infrastructure and you’re going to have some projects announced that almost all of the people in this room do not know about. Most people have given up on them, Brian. I think they’ve given up, they gave up with the rest of them. But we have some things planned in Georgia that’ll be really incredible. And everybody’s going to want it. Both Democrat, by the way, and Republican. The problem is nobody was able to get it done. We get it done. One thing I know, I know how to get things done.
Donald Trump: (40:59)
And under this administration, we will always put America first. We were putting other countries first. Now we’re putting America first. So I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank and congratulate UPS on having a great run, many years, but a great run recently. You’ve done a fantastic job, whether it’s Sky Bridge or anything else that we’ve done with you, you’ve been fantastic. I really appreciate it. But especially I appreciate a state called Georgia. It’s a special place. It’s a great place. And it’s an honor to be with you. And it’s an honor, this is where I’m announcing, this is good for the whole country. Not only Georgia, this is for the whole country, but I’m announcing it in Georgia because we have some great things planned for you. You are special people. Mr. Governor, thank you very much. Marty, thank you very much. Everybody, thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a good time."
"Jul 15, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:00)
In the last three years ICE has deported over 16,000 gang members and arrested over 2000 members of MS-13. Think of those numbers, 16,000 and arrested over 2000 members of MS-13. We’ve also deported a lot of the MS-13s out of our country. This week’s actions by the Joint Task Force, Vulcan, is the most recent offense to… really this has been a big offensive in my administration’s war on foreign gangs of which we came into this administration and we said, “What’s going on?”
President Donald Trump: (00:35)
We had gangs from countries that you wouldn’t believe. More than 20 of the criminals we indicted and arrested in the past seven days were illegal aliens. Yesterday for the first time ever the Eastern District of Virginia, thank you very much, indicted MS-13 leaders on charges of terrorism. Well, so we have the leader on charges of terrorism. And that’s a first, is that correct?
Speaker 2: (00:59)
Yes, we got him.
President Donald Trump: (00:59)
… for using terrorism, which gives us extra strength. In New York and Nevada 21 MS-13 members and leaders have been indicted on charges including murder, kidnapping, and drug trafficking. The DOJ has also announced that it will seek the death penalty for a bloodthirsty MS-13 leader responsible for the despicable killing of seven Americans, including two teenage girls. Over the past few days, the DOJ and DHS have made several arrests at high, high levels in these cases including several immigration arrests. And I want to thank Chad Wolf for working along with the FBI and with the Attorney General. They’ve work very closely together at the border and the border as you know is setting new records for allowing people in that aren’t allowed to come in, allowing people in illegally.
President Donald Trump: (01:52)
We believe the monsters who murder children should be put to death. We seem to have quite a good agreement on that. These people murder children and they do it as slowly and viciously as possible. We will not allow these animals to terrorize our communities and my administration will not rest until every member of MS-13 is brought to justice. We’ve done a great job with MS-13 but now we’re stepping it up even to a higher level. This has never happened before, there’s never been any move like this before. Much of it has already taken place, otherwise we wouldn’t be talking about it.
President Donald Trump: (02:27)
When Biden and the radical left want to open borders for MS-13 and others, we want strong borders, we want as I’ve said, we want borders. Without borders you don’t have a country and we have a great country and it’s coming back stronger than ever from job numbers to every other number, it’s coming back stronger than ever before. We’re going to have a great third quarter, we’re going to have a great fourth quarter and next year is going to be one of the strongest years economically we’ve ever had.
President Donald Trump: (02:57)
I’m going ask AG Barr, say a few words about the MS-13 and what we’ve done, and what we’re doing, and where we plan to go. And next week we’re going to have I think a very exciting news conference because we’re going to be talking about some of these cities where the Democrats running them have just lost control of the city, so that’ll be very interesting. Bill, please.
AG Barr: (03:19)
When I came into the department as attorney general the president made it clear that one of his top priorities to reduce violent crime in the United States was to destroy MS-13 in the United States. And what we’ve been in here discussing with the president is part of that effort, which is Project Vulcan or Task Force Vulcan, which is targeting the higher level players in the MS-13 operations in the United States.
AG Barr: (03:47)
MS-13 is somewhat unique in this sense. They have the street savagery that you would see in a gang. It is not driven by commercial interests the way for example the mafia traditionally was. It’s about honor of being the most savage, bloodthirsty person you can be and building up a reputation as a killer. This is in some ways is a death cult, and then they use the terror that they cause by their savagery to extort. And they’ve gotten increasingly into human trafficking and now narcotics trafficking, but that’s a sidelight to some extent to their basic purpose which is violence, terrorizing people.
AG Barr: (04:31)
Also, unlike a street gang they’re highly organized as a transnational organization. They operate with hierarchy, with programs, they call them programs, think of it as a crime family essentially. And then under each program they have different cliques. They have programs and cliques operating in the United States. While their center of gravity is in Central America there are thousands that have come into the United States illegally. They’re virtually all illegal aliens. They come in now through… although it’s harder to get across the border but traditionally they’ve come across the border into Houston and then fanned out across the United States into the different centers of activity.
AG Barr: (05:14)
Today, we were talking with the president about three actions we took. Mel [Gurdiaz 00:05:20] was indicted in the Eastern District of Virginia. First time we’ve used terrorism charges against a member of MS-13. He was responsible for activities in 13 States, 20 cliques in the United States. He was also the person who would green-light assassinations in the United States. The orders come from El Salvador, or they request to assassinate people, go down to El Salvador and he would green-light the hit.
AG Barr: (05:52)
We also took down, this was an HSI case in Las Vegas. We took down the Hollywood clique, which operated not only in Nevada but also in California and in the Eastern District of New York again, Long Island. And we took down 21 members and the leadership of that organization. And then finally… these are the New York indictees. And then finally I announced that we are going to seek the death penalty against Alexi Saenz, who is a leader in the Eastern District of New York, a leader of MS-13 there.
AG Barr: (06:41)
The president made a trip to Brentwood, New York earlier in his administration and he met with the families of victims that had been killed by MS-13, including the family of two young girls who were butchered with machetes. And the person that we are seeking the death penalty against was involved in those murders, as well as the murder of two African Americans who they just saw on the street and thought they were from a rival gang and just butchered. Those are the actions that were taken, there’s more coming as we’re going to target the leadership of MS-13. We’re working very closely with the El Salvadorians on this. They’ve been very cooperative and we have the HSI and the FBI with operations down in El Salvador.
President Donald Trump: (07:34)
In past administrations El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala did not cooperate with the United States at all, they wouldn’t let us bring people back. And under this administration a long time ago, almost my… I would say my second or third day I said, “That’s not going to work.” They’d bring them back and they’d say, “Get them out of here, we’re not taking them.” And they don’t say that anymore. They don’t even come close to say that anymore. The operation is going to be very good. This is probably the meanest worst gang anywhere in the world, the MS-13 group. And a big dent is put in them, it took place over the last few days and really over the last year, heavy focus on MS-13. They’re an evil group of people. They’re sick, they’re deranged and we’re taking care of it. And I want to just thank these great crime fighters that are with us today. Thank you.
AG Barr: (08:23)
We have Tony, from Nevada. Next, the U.S. Attorney from Eastern District of Virginia, Zach Terwilliger. Obviously another director of the FBI, Matt Albence of the ICE, Mike Carvajal of Bureau of Prisons. You might ask the why the Bureau of Prisons, because they do like to try to operate out of prisons and we have to make sure we collect intelligence in the prison system. And then Regina Lombardo of ATF, Tim Shea of DEA, and of course, you now the Secretary of DHS, Chad Wolf.
President Donald Trump: (09:00)
It’s like Central Casting. we forgot one person.
AG Barr: (09:04)
The head of this program is John Durham Jr., from the Eastern District of New York who has spent… how many years recently, John?
John Durham Jr.: (09:17)
In the office 15 years and in MS-13 for 10 years.
AG Barr: (09:20)
10 years. On Long Island, which is one of the hotbeds of MS-13 activity, or at least was.
President Donald Trump: (09:27)
Good luck, good luck. That’s really good, it’s so important. It’s like Central Casting. People are like Central Casting and you’re going to do a great job and we appreciate it. And we will be meeting you in a similar vein, but a little different subject next week. And that concerns our cities and again, people that have lost control of some of our great cities, we’re going to straighten things out. Thank you all very much, thank you. [crosstalk 00:09:51].
Speaker 6: (09:50)
Is everything all right about taking over cities earlier this week, is that right next week and how soon is that?
President Donald Trump: (09:56)
You’ll be seeing next week. We’ll have a conference next week and we’ll tell you in great detail but it’s something that I think at this point the American people want to see. They’ve been run very poorly, these cities, whether it’s Seattle, where we were getting ready to go in and they decided to go in and that’s good. Minneapolis, where we had the National Guard go in, and as soon as they did that we straightened that mess out. They should have been able to do it locally with their police. Their police are good, they were told not to do anything.
President Donald Trump: (10:24)
Or many other cases, we’re doing a great job in Portland. Portland was very rough and they called us in and we did a good job to put it mildly, many people in jail right now. But we have other cities that are out of control, they’re like more zones. And if the city isn’t going to straighten it out of local politicians, or in this case, I don’t say this for political reasons, they’re all Democrats, they’re liberal, left wing Democrats.
President Donald Trump: (10:49)
And it’s almost like they think this is going to be this way forever, where in Chicago 68 people were shot and 18 died last week. We’re not going to put up with that, we’re not going to put up with that. That’s a for our next discussion. Thank you all very much. [crosstalk 00:11:12]. I get along very well with Dr. Fauci. I get along very well with Dr. Fauci. [crosstalk 00:11:16]. I have a very good relationship, well, that spit never… but I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. Thank you very much.
Speaker 7: (11:26)
All right guys, let’s go. [crosstalk 00:11:26]. Guys, please let’s go. Friends let’s go, please. Let’s go, let’s go.
AG Barr: (11:31)
Thank you.
Speaker 8: (11:31)
Patrick, thank you."
"Jul 14, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Too hot, but it’s pretty warm. Thank you. So we’ve had a big day in the stock market. Things are coming back and they’re coming back very rapidly. A lot sooner than people thought. People are feeling good about our country. People are feeling good about therapeutics and possible vaccines, but we’re going to go over quite a bit and maybe at the end, we’ll take some questions if we have time, it’s not too hot. Today, I signed legislation and an executive order to hold China accountable for its oppressive actions against the people of Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Autonomy Act, which I signed this afternoon, passed unanimously through Congress.
Donald Trump: (00:53)
This law gives my administration powerful new tools to hold responsible the individuals and the entities involved in extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom. We’ve all watched what happened, not a good situation. Their freedom has been taken away. Their rights have been taken away and with it goes Hong Kong, in my opinion, because it will no longer be able to compete with free markets. A lot of people will be leaving Hong Kong, I suspect. And we’re going to do a lot more business because of it because we just lost one competitor. It’s the way it is. We lost a very, very serious competitor. A competitor that we incentivized to take a lot of business and do well and we gave them a lot of business by doing what we did. We gave them things that nobody else had the right to do, and that gave them a big edge over other markets.
Donald Trump: (01:43)
And because of that edge, they’ve done really historic business, tremendous business, far bigger than anybody would have thought years ago when we did this gift. It was really a gift to freedom. Today, I also signed an executive order ending US preferential treatment for Hong Kong. Hong Kong will now be treated the same as Mainland China, no special privileges, no special economic treatment and no export of sensitive technologies. In addition to that, as you know, we’re placing massive tariffs and have placed very large tariffs on China. First time that’s ever happened to China. Billions of dollars have been paid to the United States of which I’ve given quite a bit to the farmers and ranchers of our country because they were targeted. And that’s been going on for three years. It’s the first time anybody’s ever done anything like that. And prior to the plague pouring in from China, they were having the worst year as you know, in 67 years.
Donald Trump: (02:50)
And I don’t want them to have a bad year. I want them to have a good year, but they were taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, and that’s stopping. But then the virus came in and the world is a different place, but we’re now getting back and one of the reasons the market’s doing… so it’s almost at the point that it was at prior to the plague. Almost, we’re getting very close. It’s a great thing. It’s an amazing thing what our people have done and what they’ve endured. No administration has been tougher on China then this administration. We imposed historic tariffs. We stood up to China’s intellectual property theft at a level that nobody’s ever come close. We confronted untrustworthy Chinese technology and telecom providers. We convinced many countries, many countries, and I did this myself for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it’s an unsafe security risk.
Donald Trump: (03:52)
It’s a big security risk. I talked many countries out of using it. If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it. Just today, I believe that UK announced that they’re not going to be using it. And that was up in the air for a long time but they’ve decided. And you look at Italy, you look at many other countries. We withdrew from the Chinese dominated, WHO and we fully rebuilt the United States military. The WHO, World Health Organization, we were paying close to $500 million a year. China was paying $39 million a year. And China had too much say, they worked it very hard, which is a bad thing done by our past administrations. But we were tough and we were saying, I was asking, I said, “Why are we paying so much more than China?” China has 1.4 billion people. We have 325, probably 325 million approximately, nobody can give the exact count.
Donald Trump: (04:59)
We’re trying to get an exact count, but you have over the years, many illegals who have come into the country. So it depends on how you want to count it. But you could say 325 to 350 million people, as opposed to 1.4 billion people. And the World Trade is terrible, that deal is terrible. The World Health is terrible deal. We’ve been very tough on the World Trade Organization and we’ve been, I guess, as tough as you can get on World Health. We withdrew our money. We told them we’re getting out. It doesn’t mean that someday we won’t go back in. Maybe we will when it’s correctly run, but they made a lot of bad predictions and they said a lot of bad things about what to do and how to do it and they turned out to be wrong. And they were really a puppet of China.
Donald Trump: (05:49)
And make no mistake, we hold China fully responsible for concealing the virus and unleashing it upon the world. Could have stopped it, they should have stopped. It would have been very easy to do at the source when it happened. In contrast, Joe Biden’s entire career has been a gift to the Chinese Communist Party and to the calamity of errors that they’ve made. They made so many errors and it’s been devastating for the American worker. China has taken out hundreds of billions of dollars a year from our country. And we rebuilt China. I give them all the credit in the world. I don’t give the credit for the people that used to stand here because they allowed this to happen where hundreds of billions of dollars were taken out of the United States Treasury in order to rebuild China. There’s no company and no country in the world, no country in the world has ever ripped off the United States like the incredible job that they did on this country and the people that ran it.
Donald Trump: (07:03)
Possibly, it’s one of the reasons, certainly it’s one of the very big reasons trade and things related to trade that I got elected in the first place. I’ve been talking about it for a long time, along with many other subjects, frankly. Joe Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization. One of the greatest geopolitical and economic disasters in world history. If you look at China, you look at the moment they joined the World Trade, they were flatlining for years and years and years and decades. And then all of a sudden they joined the World Trade Organization and they went like a rocket ship. They were given all sorts of advantages. They were considered a developing country. As a developing country they got tremendous advantages over the United States and other countries, and they took advantage of those advantages and then some. Biden personally led the effort to give China permanent, most favored nation status, which is a tremendous advantage for a country to have. Few countries have it. But the United States doesn’t have it. Never did, probably never even asked for it because they didn’t know what they were doing. As Vice President Biden was a leading advocate of the Paris Climate Accord, which was unbelievably expensive to our country. Would have crushed American manufacturers while allowing China to pollute the atmosphere with impunity yet one more gift from Biden to the Chinese Communist Party. They took all of the advantage away from us. They took everything away. They don’t have oil. We would have had to close up a tremendous amounts of our energy to qualify, eventually, not too far into the future. We would have had to do things that would have been unbelievably destructive to our country, including the possible closing of 25% of our businesses, think of that.
Donald Trump: (09:10)
And it was going to cost us hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars for the privilege of being involved in the Paris Climate Accord. And you just have to look at what took place this year in Paris and France, where money was being sent to countries all over the world and the people of France didn’t want to take it. And they didn’t. And they did a lot of rioting. They had their taxes raised. We would have had to raise our taxes and it was a disaster. I’ve been given a lot of credit for what I did there. Took a certain amount of courage, I guess, because it sounds so nice, the Paris Climate Accord. But it wasn’t good for us at all. America lost nearly 10,000 factories while Joe Biden was Vice President, think of that. 10,000 factories. He wrote something today and he made a statement today that I wrote down. It’s pretty accurate.
Donald Trump: (10:13)
So Biden was here for 47 years. Eight years, the last eight years, not long ago as Vice President he said, “One in five miles of our highways are still in poor condition.” Well, we’re doing a good job on highways, but why didn’t he fix them three years ago? Why didn’t he fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges are in disrepair and on the verge of collapse. Well, that’s probably not a right number, but we have bridges that should have been fixed. Why didn’t he fix him? He was here for eight years with President Obama. Why didn’t they fix them? Tens of thousands of bridges. This is what he wrote. High speed broadband. We want high speed… well, why didn’t they get it? Three years ago is not a long time and he didn’t do any of the things, but now he says he’s going to be president and as president, he’s going to do all the things that he didn’t do.
Donald Trump: (11:10)
He never did anything except make very bad decisions, especially on foreign policy. So Joe Biden and President Obama freely allowed China to pillage our factories, plunder our communities and steal our most precious secrets. And I’ve stopped it, largely, but I’ve stopped it and it wasn’t easy because you talk about a certain power of the telephone and the calls where they would call and say, “No, we don’t want to do that.” And other countries would call on behalf of China, but I did it. I did what has to be done. And you just take a look at what’s gone on and take a look at the numbers where they devalued their currency in order to pay the tariffs. Now, the Democrat party is calling for defunding of our military, think of that.
Donald Trump: (12:02)
Defunding, they want to defund our military when China is building a massive military. They’re building a massive military and Biden wants to defund our military and the world needs American strength right now, more than ever. And we’ve got it. We’ve got now, soon as all this equipment comes in, all made in the USA, we’ve got the newest, most incredible weapons anywhere in the world. We have the best tanks, the best ships, the best missiles, rockets. We have the best of everything. We have the best fighter jets, the F-35, the F-18. All of these assets are being built, tankers, incredible tankers, bombers. Hope we don’t have to use them, but we have the most incredible military. When I came in the military was totally depleted. It was at a level that was just absolutely incredible. You know the statements, I made the statements before. I told you what generals told me about our military and I’ll make them again.
Donald Trump: (13:13)
If somebody needs them, we’ll give them to you. Very well documented. As Vice President Biden opposed tariffs, and he was standing up for China. He didn’t want to do anything to disrupt the relationship with China even though China was taking us to the cleaners. He opposed my very strict travel ban on Chinese nationals to stop the spread of the China virus. He was totally against it. Xenophobic, he called me. Xenophobic. A month later, he admitted I was right. We would have had thousands of people additionally die if we let people come in from heavily infected China, but we stopped it. We did a travel ban in January. Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco a month later and even later than that and others too. They all thought what I did was a terrible mistake. We would have lost… in fact, Dr. Fauci said we would have lost thousands of additional people if President Trump had to do that. And I was a crowd of one, because even experts didn’t want to do it. They thought it was a mistake.
Donald Trump: (14:25)
And then I did Europe. When I started seeing what was going on in Italy and Spain and France and other countries in Europe I did a ban on people coming in from Europe. That would have been disastrous for our country also. And we saved tens of thousands of lives, but we actually saved millions of lives. By closing up, we saved millions, potentially, millions of lives. Could be, a number that we’re actually working on, but it could be 2 to 3 million lives. So we’re at 135,000, which is terrible. One is too much, but we would have had millions of people dead from this curse that came at us, but we did what we had to do. And now we’ll put out the flames as it happens. We have to get the schools open. We have to get everything open. A lot of people don’t want to do that for political reasons, not for other reasons.
Donald Trump: (15:23)
But if we had listened to Joe Biden, hundreds of thousands of additional lives would have been lost. And if you look at the job he did on swine flu, I looked at a poll. They have polls on everything nowadays and they got very bad marks on the job they did on the swine flu. H1N1, he calls it N1H1. H1N1 got very poor marks from Gallup on the job they did on swine flu. And they stopped very early on, testing. They totally stopped it. They just said stop. And frankly, if we didn’t test, you wouldn’t have all the headlines because we’re showing cases.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
And frankly, if we didn’t test, you wouldn’t have all the headlines because we’re showing cases. And we have just about the lowest mortality rate. But if we did… Think of this, if we didn’t do testing, instead of testing over 40 million people, if we did half the testing, we would have half the cases. If we did another… You cut that in half, we’d have yet again, half of that, but the headlines are always testing. Now the testing is a good thing, but at the same time, it’s fodder for the fake news to report cases. So we’re doing 40 million plus, going to be very close to 45 million people. And when I turned on the news, I see cases, cases, cases. They don’t talk about deaths being cut down to a level that actually tenfold they use. I got that from one of the very respected media outlets, tenfold, cut tenfold, yes, but they don’t talk about that.
Donald Trump: (17:01)
They talk about cases and the cases are created because of the fact that we do tremendous testing. We’re the best testing in the world. We now make ventilators for the world. We had very few ventilators. There wasn’t one person in any hospital anywhere in this country that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. And that was because we mobilized to a level, using the Purchasing Act in some cases, we mobilized to a level that nobody thought possible. Nothing’s happened like that since World War II. Our task force has done a great job. Mike Pence works so hard, gets so little credit. Sad to see that actually, but he works so hard, gets so little credit. The governors would tell us, we’d be on the phone with 50 different governors, they’d all tell us what a great job, great job. And then they’ll go to the media and say, “Well, they didn’t do such a good job.” Well, we did a great job. We made a lot of governors look fantastic.
Donald Trump: (17:57)
We did in New York, what we did in New York was one of the most incredible things, 2,800 bed in Javits Center, but the governor used very few of them unfortunately. Then we moved in our great hospital ship, one of our two great… We move one also to Los Angeles. And we could have used that for our senior citizens. We could have used it for other people. They could have used it instead of sending our seniors back into nursing homes that were infected where you lost thousands of people. Thousands of people in New York died because of poor management by the governor. And it’s a very sad thing to see and very sad to watch and very sad to look at those statistics.
Donald Trump: (18:38)
But we have an incredible Javits Center that we built with thousands of beds. I think it was 2,800 all ready to go and they could have sent people there, or they could have sent senior citizens there instead of sending them into the nursing homes. And after all of that work and getting it done, the Army Corps of Engineers, I mean, the job they did was incredible. They built it in a matter of days. When it was all completed, FEMA, everybody was there, doctors. We ended up getting doctors. They said, “We can’t man it.” I said, “So we’ll man it and woman it.” And that’s what we did. We brought in doctors, nurses, everything, we’re all set. We said, “Where are the people?” They didn’t send the people. Very few people came in. They could have sent them into the Javits Center. They could have sent him to the hospital ship, which was virtually unused. But we were there.
Donald Trump: (19:34)
By contrast, my administration acted very early to ban travel from China, from Europe, saving all of these lives, incredible. And I want everyone to know, I want every citizen now that we’re using the full power of the Federal government to fight the China virus and to keep our people safe. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will deliver a vaccine in record breaking time. We’re doing very well on the vaccines. We have many, many different vaccines being studied right now, many of which are looking really good. And we’re ready to distribute the vaccine when we get it. We’re all set, taking a risk, an economic risk of preparing for delivery because we feel very certain it’s going to be there, but logistically we have our military ready to go. We have generals that that’s all they do is distribute things and they’re going to be distributing hopefully a vaccine or a therapeutic, and it’s coming out really well.
Donald Trump: (20:35)
And I think you’re going to have some good news very, very quickly having to do with the vaccines. We’re also working with many other countries on the vaccine. Many countries are working with us. We’re unleashing our nation’s scientific genius to kill the virus. Joe Biden didn’t just side with China on the virus, he did. He called me again, xenophobic. That’s what he said. You all heard it many times. He described the rise of China as “a very positive development”. It’s not a positive development. Not for us it’s not. He said that the idea that China is our competition is really bizarre. He’s really bizarre. He said, “China is not a problem.” No, nobody’s ripped us off more than China over the last 25, 30 years, nobody close. And he says China is not a problem. Now he takes it all back. Now he wants to be Mr. Tough Guy.
Donald Trump: (21:32)
But for years, 47 years, he never came out against China, never say anything bad. Just the opposite. His son walked out with $1.5 billion of money to invest where he’ll make hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe millions of dollars a year, walked out with $1.5 billion. I asked one of the biggest people on Wall Street, maybe the biggest, “Is that possible?” He said, “No,” he’s never seen it. They don’t do that. But Hunter, where’s Hunter, where is Hunter by the way? Hunter Biden walked out with $1.5 billion. In Ukraine he got $83,000 a month and I guess an upfront payment of $3 million. So he went from not having job to getting $83,000 a month with a lot of money paid up front to work for Burisma. And you all know about Burisma, but nothing happens, nobody cares. And he was unemployed as you know, he was unfortunately forced to leave the military. He was forced to leave. Didn’t have a job and all of a sudden he’s making a fortune, but nobody talks about that. Indeed Biden expressed more fawning praise about China on an ordinary day than about America. On the 4th of July, the last Independence Day, Biden attacked the United States and said we had, “never lived up to the ideals of our fathers, our forefathers, or our founding fathers, those founding ideals.” And yet he enthusiastically stated that China is a great nation and we should hope for its continued expansion. Well, we all wish well to China, but what China has unleashed on the world, it’s hard to even fathom. I see people now, friends of mine, they walk up, they want to say hello, and they have to keep their distance and they’re all covered up like you’re all covered up with face masks. It’s a different world, but we’re coming out on top.
Donald Trump: (23:40)
Biden sides with China over America time and time again. And he said on the 4th of July, “American history is no fairytale.” And yet blindly celebrates China saying few nations in history have come so far so fast. He’s so proud of them. He’s so proud of them. Now, Joe Biden is pushing a platform that would demolish the U.S. economy, totally demolish it. So we built the greatest economy in the history of our country, greatest in the history of the world. That was a few months ago. Best unemployment numbers ever, best for African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, best for women, best for everybody, best for young people that didn’t have a high school diploma, didn’t have a college diploma. They had a diploma, they were really in good shape.
Donald Trump: (24:39)
We built the greatest ever stock market, highest ever in history. We had 143 days of all time stock market highs in just less than three and a half years. And we had to close it down because we did the right thing by doing that. As I said, we saved millions of lives, but China was saying this is incredible what’s going on. China was for the first time respecting the United States and now they want to do something that’s much different, Joe Biden.
Donald Trump: (25:12)
So I’ve watched this and I’ve watched it with great interest. We’re building our economy again. I guess the stock market went up almost 500 points today or something thereabouts, you’ll check. But it was up a lot when I left. And our economy is coming back. We’re almost at a level where even though it’s long before the very important, maybe the most important ever, election of November 3rd. We’re long before that, but we’re close to record stock markets again. And NASDAQ hit an all time high for the 16th time. Think of that, for the 16th time over the last month or so, for the 16th time. So one of our markets already hit an all time high. Today Joe Biden gave a speech in which he said that the core of his economic agenda is a hard left crusade against American energy. He wants to kill American energy. He wants to reenter the unfair one sided Paris Climate Accord, which will destroy us at the expense of many other nations who benefit. It was actually drawn in my opinion, to take advantage of the United States, just like so many other deals that are done to take advantage of the fools running the United States. But this would do nothing for the environment, but would cripple American industry while greatly helping China. He wants to impose massive energy taxes and job crushing mandates to eliminate carbon from the United States economy. Let him define the word carbon because he won’t be able to. Obliterating American oil, clean coal, natural gas, and the natural energy resources that supply countless American jobs.
Donald Trump: (27:06)
Joe Biden put AOC, a young woman not talented in many ways, in charge of his energy plan and the environment essentially. Her and Bernie Sanders who ran a lot of times for president, never made it. Good base, but that’s about it. In other words, he wants to impose the Green New Deal on our country. When I first saw the Green New Deal, I thought it was a joke. I said, “This will never go anywhere.” Now they’re trying to impose it. This will destroy our country and make us non-competitive with other countries. Don’t forget, we’re in competition with China and with many other countries throughout the world. We’re in tremendous economic competition, including Europe, which has never treated us well.
Donald Trump: (27:59)
The European union was formed in order to take advantage of the United States. They formed and they take advantage of the United States. And I know that, they know I know that, but other presidents had no idea. Last week, Joe Biden released his unity platform developed with socialist Bernie Sanders, describing what he would do if elected president. The Biden Sanders agenda is the most extreme platform of any major party nominee by far in American history. I think it’s worse than actually Bernie’s platform. It’s gone so far, right? And he’s doing that because he’s begging for that vote. But one of the things I just asked my people to do is just draw up for me just quickly some of the things that we’ve been hearing about over the last couple of weeks. And these are actual key elements of the Biden Sanders unity platform.
Donald Trump: (28:58)
Abolish immigration detention, no more detention. You come in here illegally, no more detention. Stop all deportations. So if we get a MS-13 gang member, which we’ve taken out of our country by the thousands, brought them back to Honduras, Guatemala, can’t do that anymore. El Salvador, can’t do that anymore. Stop all deportations. In other words, we’ll take all of these people, many of whom are in prison for rape, murder, lots of other things. End prosecution of illegal border crossers. Oh, okay. They come in illegally and we have to stop the whole process. Support the deadly sanctuary cities where many of these people are protected better than the American citizen is protected. Incentivize illegal alien child smuggling. Give it an incentive because if you look at what they’re saying, that’s exactly what they do. Incentivize illegal alien child smuggling. They’re incentivized by what this plan calls for.
Donald Trump: (30:05)
Expand asylum for all new illegal aliens. How about that one? All new illegal aliens, expand asylum. Cancel all asylum cooperation agreements in the Western hemisphere. Well, we have agreements with Honduras, Guatemala, with El Salvador, we have great agreements where when Biden and Obama used to bring killers out, they would say, “Don’t bring them back to our country. We don’t want them.” Well, we have to, we don’t want them. They wouldn’t take them. Now with us, they take them. Someday I’ll tell you why. Someday I’ll tell you why, but they take them and they take them very gladly. They used to bring them out and they wouldn’t even let the airplanes land if they brought them back by airplanes. They wouldn’t let the buses into their country. They said, “We don’t want them.” They said no, but they entered our country illegally. And they’re murderers, they’re killers in some cases. And they said, “Nope, we don’t want them.” They turned the bus around. They turned the plane around that land in the United States and who knows what happened to him, but it wasn’t good.
Donald Trump: (31:15)
Taxpayer-funded lawyers will be given to all illegal aliens. So we’re going to pay now for the lawyer’s lobby and we’re going to give all illegal aliens taxpayer-funded lawyers. How does that sound? Pretty good. In other words, come in here illegally, we’re going to give you free legal advice. We’ll take you up to the Supreme Court as much as possible. Abolish immigration enforcement against illegal workers. Think of that, abolish immigration enforcement. They’re going to abolish immigration enforcement. Well, basically, as you know, what they’re going to do is they’re going to rip down the wall. They’re taking it down. They want to take down the wall, which we fought hard for up to 259 miles right now of great powerful wall that’s really working because if you look at the numbers, in addition to the fact…
Donald Trump: (32:03)
Wall that’s really working because if you look at the numbers, in addition to the fact that Mexico, for various reasons, has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border to keep people out of our country. And I appreciate it. We had a great meeting last week with the President of Mexico. Great guy, friend of mine, become a friend of mine. A lot of people thought that couldn’t happen because we’re very opposite in terms of our views, maybe even in terms of our temperament, but he’s a great guy, and he’s a friend of mine, and they’ve been terrific. Mexico has been terrific. 27,000 soldiers on our border, Mexican soldiers, and we have great, great numbers. We got rid of so many different things.
Donald Trump: (32:45)
Catch and release is gone. So many different things have taken place. We used to catch them, take their name, and release them into our country. We don’t do that anymore. We now release them back where they came from. Sometimes we’ll bring them back to their country. Grant work permits for illegal aliens, so if you come in illegally, you get a work permit. People that live here don’t get work permits, many cases. Provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for illegal aliens and new immigrants. So we want to provide taxpayer subsidies and welfare for people that come into our country illegally, illegal immigrants. They want government healthcare for all illegal aliens. This is part of their plan. I’m not making this up. This is all down in their plan from last week.
Donald Trump: (33:37)
And this is good compared to what I heard today. Federal student aid and free community college for illegal aliens. What do you think about that? Federal student aid and free community college. We’re going to have every person in the world pouring into our country from all over the world. And by the way, the wall was so timely because it stopped people coming in from heavily infected areas of Mexico. If we had that, we would be in trouble like you wouldn’t believe. You wouldn’t believe. And remember, cases is different than deaths. And cases, we give you because our testing is the best in the world.
Donald Trump: (34:19)
And by the way, by far the most, find out which country tested 45 million people. If China, if Russia, if India tested 45 million people, or if they did tests like we did, check out how many cases they’d have. But it’s still, we’ve done a great job. Get no credit for it. And I don’t want the credit. I want the people that have done this great job. The people that have done such an incredible job when building the ventilators, and doing the testing, and building a testing platform that’s been amazing. We have many platforms. Many companies have come up with different forms of tests. When we started there was no such thing.
Donald Trump: (34:58)
Sign new immigrants up for welfare immediately. This is Joe Biden. So they walk off and they come in and they put a foot into our land, and we sign up new immigrants up for welfare. We sign them up immediately. They get welfare benefits. United States citizens. Don’t get what they’re looking to give illegal immigrants. Think of that. Sign up. It’s hard to believe I’m even reading that, new immigrants for welfare immediately. Not to mention the cost of this which is incalculable. The cost of this is so crazy.
Donald Trump: (35:39)
End requirement for immigrant self-sufficiency and maximize their welfare. Now, this is us writing this. Who’s not coming to the United States? Every person from South America is going to pour in. Every person from other countries, they’re going to be pouring in. End requirement, think of that, for immigrant self-sufficiency and remember to maximize welfare. So we give it a maximum. Then we have massively expand immigration during a global pandemic, taking jobs from unemployed Americans. End all travel bans including from Jihadist regions. So now we have travel bans. A lot of you said I didn’t get the travel ban and you were wrong. We got the travel ban. We lost in the Ninth Circuit. We lost again in the Ninth Circuit. And then we won in the Supreme Court. We have a very strong travel ban, and we don’t want people that are going to come in and blow up our cities, do things.
Donald Trump: (36:49)
And frankly, with the liberal Democrats running the cities that we do have where they do have problems, maybe they wouldn’t mind, but I would mind, and the people of this country mind. So listen to this. End all travel bans. He’s talking about the ban that I won that everybody said I didn’t win. They said I didn’t win because in the Lower Court we lost, that we lost in the Appellate Division and then we won in the Supreme Court. So they said, “He lost,” and they’re right at the Lower Level. But in the meantime, we won in the Supreme Court. So it’s in effect, but they didn’t say that. They said he lost, which again is fake news, but that’s the way they do it. So end all travel bans including from Jihadist regions, they specify that.
Donald Trump: (37:32)
Grant mass amnesty. Everybody gets amnesty, mass amnesty. Think of that. And this has created a roadmap to citizenship for massive, massive numbers. And we’re not talking about DACA because I’m going to take care of DACA much better than the Democrats did. The Democrats had their chance and they blew it. But we’re going to take care of DACA because I’m going to be doing, in the not too distant future, pretty soon I’m going to be signing a new immigration action, very, very big merit based immigration action. That based on the DACA decision, I’ll be able to do. Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. So they want a lot of people come in with low skills. I like merit. Think of that. Vastly expand low-skilled immigration to the United States. These are the things that are in the plan. This is Biden. Biden’s gone radical left.
Donald Trump: (38:36)
Increase refugee admissions by 700%. Huh? That’s a lot, by 700%. Nobody’s ever heard of such a thing. Increase refugee admissions by 700%. Abolish law enforcement as we know it. I think the police do an incredible job in this country. And you’re going to have a rogue, terrible cop on occasion, like you do doing any industry, in any business, in any profession. But I think they do an incredible job. Abolish law enforcement as we know it. End cash bail, no bail. Just, we let you right out. Look at what’s happened to New York. Crime is up. Shootings are up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen before. Look at Chicago. What a disaster. And we’re waiting for them to call us because we’re all set to go. We have the FBI. We have Homeland Security. We have everybody ready to go. We have the National Guard. They’re all ready to go. End cash bail, releasing dangerous criminals onto our streets, cash bail. New York just did that. Other places have done it. They haven’t turned out too good.
Donald Trump: (39:53)
Abolish completely the death penalty. And I know there’s a lot of debate on the death penalty and that has been for a long time, but sometimes you use the death penalty depending on the crime. You know what happened today with regard to the death penalty. Appoint social justice prosecutors in order to free violent criminals. So they want to appoint social justice prosecutors to free violent criminals. End mandatory minimums. And that’s by empowering judges to determine appropriate sentences by fighting to repeal mandatory minimums at the federal level and give states incentives to repeal their mandatory minimums. We could go on for days.
Donald Trump: (40:48)
Incentivize prison closure. So they want to close our prisons. They want to abolish our police departments. They want to abolish our prisons, I guess. Incentivize jail and prison closures as populations decline. Ensure the resources saved are invested directly into those communities. So they want to close them rather than have them for some very bad people, people that are not going to behave when they get out. You see that in New York. They allowed a lot of criminals out and those criminals are causing havoc. And then they got rid of their incredible and legendary crime squad and bad things are happening in New York. Bad things are happening. I love New York. I hate to see what’s going on.
Donald Trump: (41:41)
End solitary confinement. Free federal housing for former inmates. So federal housing now can go to inmates, former inmates. Rejoined Paris climate accord, and seek an even higher level of restrictions. Oh, I didn’t notice that. Oh, I see. So they want to rejoin the Paris climate accord and they want to seek an even higher level of [inaudible 00:42:09]. In other words, make it worse than it was. Mandate net zero carbon emissions for homes, offices, and all new buildings by 2030, that basically means no windows, no nothing. It’s very hard to do. I tell people when they want to go into some of these buildings, “How are your eyes? Because they won’t be good in five years.”
Donald Trump: (42:35)
And I hope you don’t mind cold office space in the winter and warm office space in the summer, because your air conditioning is not the same as the good old days. Mandate zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. Zero, we’re talking about zero. Nothing can go in the air. Mandate net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And I believe he’s changing that. He’s bringing it down. He wants no petroleum product. He wants no oil or gas. I don’t think Texas is going to do too well. They’re going to get rid of about 7 million jobs if you go by the Biden plan. I don’t think that Oklahoma, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, you’re going to be too happy with that, and many other states, Ohio.
Donald Trump: (43:25)
Mandate all 500,000 school buses and all three million government vehicles be changed to zero emission vehicles within five years. I’ve heard of worse than that. Install 500,000 taxpayer funded charging stations nationwide. Here’s a bad one, really bad one. End school choice. There is nothing that the African American community wants more than school choice, and mothers and fathers are going to be very happy to see him be defeated just on that alone. End school choice. So Joe Biden wants to end school choice. End tax credit scholarship serving disadvantaged students in 26 states. Oppose 14 million Americans with education savings accounts and get rid of school choice, having to do with school choice. Eliminate school choice in Washington, D.C. You know what they’ve done in Washington. They have some incredible example right here, example. I know of one example. I think they have a number of them, but one is incredible. Abolish all charter schools. Charter schools are doing great. Ban funding for charter schools in poor neighborhoods. We don’t want charter schools in poor neighborhoods.
Donald Trump: (44:53)
Well, that’s not fair. Abolish educational standards. Abolish, in the suburbs, you’re going to abolish the suburbs with this, and force Obama/Biden’s radical AFFH, that’s the AFFH regulation that threatens to strip localities of federal affordable housing funds or less unless they changed their zoning laws to fit the federal government’s demands. So what you have, I mean, I’ve been watching this for years in Westchester, coming from New York. They want a low income housing built in a neighborhood. Well, I’m ending that rule. I’m taking it out. So I had spoke with Ben Carson the other day. We’re going to be taking it out. I’ve watched that whole thing go, and now they want to make it twice as bad in the suburbs, ib the suburbs. Mothers aren’t happy about that. Fathers aren’t happy about that. They worked hard to buy a house and now they’re going to watch the housing values drop like a rock. And that has happened. Drop like a rock. So we’re not going to do that. We’re going to do the exact opposite.
Donald Trump: (46:04)
Probably there has never been a time, and this is just a few. It’s much worse than that. We did this very quickly. There’s probably never been a time when candidates are so different. We want law and order. They don’t want law and order. We want strong, closed borders with people able to come in through merit, through a legal process. They don’t want to have any borders at all. They’re going to rip down the wall. It was hard to get that built. And now it’s almost completed. It’ll be completed by a little after the end of the year. They want to rip it down and it’s had such an impact. It’s incredible. It stops trafficking, human trafficking of women and children, but women mostly. Human trafficking, one of the worst things ever, all at a that it’s never been at because of the internet. You think of it as an ancient statement. You wouldn’t think that’s possible today, but it’s human trafficking of women and children. And they want to let that continue. The wall has stopped it so much because they will go over to a section where there aren’t people, not an entry point, and they’ll make a left into the United States and they’re on their way. They can’t do that anymore. We have a 30 foot wall that goes six feet into the ground, stops a lot of the tunneling, because they’re pretty good at tunnels. But we watch the tunnels and we have equipment for that. You can’t make a left anymore and come into the United States loaded up with human traffic. So they want to take down the wall. They want to have open borders. Think of open borders today though with the pandemic. I mean, the timing is sort of interesting, but with the pandemic.
Donald Trump: (47:49)
So there’s never been a time when too candidates were so different. I mean, I’ve seen races where it’s like the same exact platforms. I’m even talking about essentially Democrat Republic-
Donald Trump: (48:03)
… exact platforms. I’m even talking about essentially Democrat, Republican, there’s not that much difference. There’s a little difference, but there’s not much. You choose one because you like the way they look, you like the way they sound. You like the way they talk. You like something about one, and you don’t like the other, but there have never been a difference. Here’s one of the greatest ever.
Donald Trump: (48:21)
This is without question the single biggest difference. If you want law and order, for instance, I enacted recently when I saw what was going on with federal monuments, we don’t have the right to do states, although we’re trying to find it. But with the monuments, where they wanted to rip down Andrew Jackson. They wanted to rip down George Washington. They were actually heading over to the Jefferson Memorial, if you can believe that. But this has been going on, and I found an act that we’ve used and we have many, many people in jail right now. Many, many people in jail, all over the country, because they tried to destroy or in some cases got it down, a federal statue or monument.
Donald Trump: (49:09)
We haven’t had anybody making a move since I enacted this. I signed an executive order a couple of weeks ago, and it says very simply, “10 years in jail. You do it, 10 years in jail.” The amazing part is we’re able to catch everybody, because thanks to all of you on television, we appreciate it. But we have their pictures, they have the man standing on Andrew Jackson’s horse. We have the man standing by General George Washington. We have everybody standing… and oh, they were going to go for the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln, standing with a young man who is being freed. And we said, “We’re going to do something. We can’t let this happen.”
Donald Trump: (50:04)
Now, it could be removed at some point. You go through a process, a legal process, go through Congress, whatever. I understand that. At the same time, some people like these statues and monuments, but it can be removed, but you have to go through a legal process. So they were going to have 20-25,000 people that night, nobody showed up. Nobody. You know that, because you were disappointed to see that. The next night, I believe 22 people showed up. They said, “We’re going to make it Friday night instead,” and 22 people showed up. Four were actually arrested, because we have pictures of them knocking down other statues, so they’re in jail now.
Donald Trump: (50:45)
So there has never been an election where we’ve had this kind of difference. We want strong borders, without borders, you’ve heard me say it a thousand times. Without borders, you don’t have a country. They don’t want to have borders. They want to have open borders. It’s radical left and it’ll destroy our country. 20 years ago, Venezuela was a very rich country, one of the richest. One of the richest anywhere, per capita one of the richest. Tremendous oil reserves. Now they don’t have water, they don’t have food, they don’t have medicine. We do everything we can to take care of the people, but they have nothing.
Donald Trump: (51:29)
And that’s exactly the ideology that you have going over here. If I wasn’t there to stop it, if I wasn’t here to say, “No way, that’s not going to happen,” we’d be in some mess. We’d be in some mess, and Pelosi and Schumer and Bernie and Joe, they’ll never stop it. They don’t have the power, the strength to stop it. It’s beyond them, but we do. So there’s never been a time like this, where you’ve had an election of people so different. Okay, couple of questions? Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (52:11)
Sir, you just spent the better part of an hour explaining why Americans should choose you and not your opponent. Yesterday, you said on Twitter, “Be careful what you wish for.” I guess the question is, do you see yourself as the underdog in this race? Do you see yourself losing in the fall?
Donald Trump: (52:23)
No, I don’t. I think we have really good poll numbers. They’re not suppression polls, they’re real polls. You look at the intercostal in Florida, you look at the Lakes, you see thousands of boats with Trump signs, American signs, you’ve got the Trump Pence sign all over. You look at what’s going on, you look at bikers for miles and miles riding up highways proudly with their signs. We won a race where it was the same thing, 2016. We had polls that were fake. They turned out to be fake. Not all, a couple of them got it right. Three of them, to be exact. Three of them. One of them was unsuspecting, but they got it right. They were very proud of it.
Donald Trump: (53:09)
But we had in 2016 something even more so, but we got in and we had 306 to I guess, 223, which was a tremendous margin of difference. You remember, they all said, “He cannot get to 270.” I went to Maine a number of times, where we just freed up lobster fishing and fishing. They took away 5,000 square miles from Maine. I just opened it up and I just got rid of tariffs in China. And we’re working on European Union, which charge our fishermen tariffs, and I said, “You’re not going to do that.” So we freed it up for Maine, but if you take a look, we went up there recently. There were crowds; thousands of people lined up going over to a factory where we were opening up for… We’re making swabs. A beautiful big, new factory making swabs.
Donald Trump: (53:59)
I think that the enthusiasm now is greater and maybe far greater than it was in 2016. I think a lot of people don’t want to talk about it. I think they’re not going to say, “Hey, I’m for Trump, I’m for Trump,” they don’t want to go through the process. And I fully understand that, because the process is not fair. The media doesn’t treat us fairly. They never have, and perhaps they never will. But maybe they will when we turn this around for a second term, and it’s going to happen very quickly.
Donald Trump: (54:27)
When we turn it around for a second time, maybe they will. I think we’re doing very well in the polls, and I think you have a silent majority the likes of which this country has never seen before. This is a very important election. We’ve done a great job. We had to turn it off, as I said. Turn it off, and now we’ve started it again. As you know, they announced two weeks ago record job numbers, almost five million people. And that beat the last month, which was also a record, 2.8 million people. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done, and now we’re doing it twice. I think by election day, you’re going to see some incredible numbers. The third quarter is going to be really good. Fourth quarter’s going to be great, but next year’s going to be one of the best economic years. So, hopefully I’ll be able to be the President where we say, “Look at the great job I did.”
Speaker 2: (55:22)
[inaudible 00:55:22] This point?
Donald Trump: (55:23)
I think great. I think we have a great chance. I think we’re going to have a lot of people show up. I’m very worried about mail-in voting because I think it’s subject to tremendous fraud and being rigged. Do you see that Paterson, New Jersey, where I believe it was 20% of the vote was fraudulent? It was all sorts of things happened. I understand a mailman was recently indicted someplace for playing games with the mail-in ballots.
Donald Trump: (55:48)
You’ll have tremendous fraud if you do these mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are okay, because absentee ballots, you have to get applications. You have to go through a process. If I’m here, and I vote in Florida, you get an absentee ballot. But you have to go through a process. Absentee ballots are great, but mail-in voting, where a governor mails millions of ballots to people all over the state. California, millions and millions of ballots, as an [inaudible 00:56:15]… and then they come back, they don’t come back. Who got them? Did you forget to send them to a Republican area or a Democrat area, I guess you could say? But if you take a look at all of the unbelievable fraud that’s been involved with mail-in voting over the last even short period of a while, but look at Paterson, New Jersey.
Donald Trump: (56:35)
It was a massive error and a massive miscalculation and there was incredible fraud. Look at the city council, what’s happened to it. This is one place, but you have many places and they’re all over. Yes, please?
Speaker 3: (56:53)
Thank you, sir. I wanted to know, when’s the last time you spoke with President Xi of China, and do you plan to speak with him in the near future?
Donald Trump: (57:00)
No, I haven’t spoken to him. No, I don’t. I have no plan to speak to him. Yeah, please. Go.
Speaker 3: (57:04)
Sir, a follow [crosstalk 00:57:05]-
Speaker 4: (57:06)
Do you want to do a follow up?
Speaker 3: (57:06)
Yeah, if you don’t mind.
Speaker 4: (57:08)
Okay. Yeah. Is it okay?
Donald Trump: (57:08)
Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (57:11)
I just wanted to know, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was hospitalized today with an infection. Wanted to know if you had any reaction to that news?
Donald Trump: (57:17)
No, I wish her the best. I hope she’s better. I didn’t hear that, actually. She was just hospitalized? No, that’s too bad. No, I wish her the best.
Speaker 4: (57:26)
[crosstalk 00:57:26]-
Donald Trump: (57:26)
She’s actually giving me some good rulings. Okay? So, you know that, right? People are surprised. No, I wish her the absolute best. Please.
Speaker 4: (57:36)
Thank you, Mr. President. So, you had mentioned the travel bans, and I wondered when do you plan to review that because the European continent is… Their situation is under control, much a better place than the US and there is no [inaudible 00:57:49] for other hot spots like Russia and India. So what will be the criteria to change that? And another question-
Donald Trump: (57:55)
We banned for Europe, and at some point, that’ll come off. And we’re dealing with them all the time. The relationship’s very good, they just don’t treat us very well on trade. They have been very unfair to us over many, many decades. We’re doing that. It’s very easy to solve. I was all set to solve it, actually, and then we got hit with the plague. But we have a travel ban on various countries, and that travel ban remains until such time as we say it doesn’t remain.
Speaker 4: (58:21)
And [crosstalk 00:58:22]-
Donald Trump: (58:22)
We want our country safe. Unlike Biden, we don’t want to have criminals pouring into our country. We don’t want to have open borders. We’re not going to have that, and we want to take care of our police. We want to actually fund our police, not defund them. We’re not going to abolish our police and we’re not going to make our military small and weak because probably or at least at top of the level, we need our military right now. Yeah, go ahead please.
Speaker 4: (58:50)
So, how do you think an America First policy can work during a pandemic? Aren’t you concerned that this could actually damage the US and make China more influence around the world?
Donald Trump: (59:02)
Okay, look, my policy’s America First. We’ve lost hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China and many other countries. What we’re doing is just handing everybody everything. It’s just sad. I’ve watched it, I’ve looked at it. We did the US Mexico, you saw that? USMCA? We made a very fair deal on trade. We had the worst deal ever. Right, you know that? We had the worst deal ever, and it replaced that. It replaced that horrible NAFTA deal that was one of the worst trade deals ever made.
Donald Trump: (59:35)
I’ll tell you, the only deal that might be worse is the WTO, World Trade Organization. Maybe worse. OAN, please?
OANN Reporter: (59:43)
Thank you, Mr. President. Your administration has taken tangible steps to ensure that Chinese companies are not taking advantage of our US stock markets-
Donald Trump: (59:54)
It’s true.
OANN Reporter: (59:54)
… our trade. Last week, your administration sent a letter to the Railroad Retirement Board, asking them to reconsider investments in Chinese defense firms.
Donald Trump: (01:00:06)
Meaning, not to invest?
OANN Reporter: (01:00:08)
Correct.
Donald Trump: (01:00:08)
That’s correct.
OANN Reporter: (01:00:08)
So, where is that request now? And are you taking tangible actions to ensure that US investments don’t continue to fund-
Donald Trump: (01:00:16)
Yes.
OANN Reporter: (01:00:16)
… defense firms in China?
Donald Trump: (01:00:18)
Yes, and you’ll see more coming. This was a very important bill that we signed, but you’re going to see more coming over the next short period of time. But yes, we don’t want them investing in Chinese military companies, okay?
OANN Reporter: (01:00:30)
What [crosstalk 01:00:30], I mean, what actions can be taken to ensure that that does not happen?
Donald Trump: (01:00:33)
Well, you got a lot of actions we can take, including the increase. Right now, people don’t know, China’s paying a lot of tariffs. We made a China deal, and they bought just I think the third highest amount of corn ever in world history, they just bought from us. The highest amount, which is great for our farmers, but I view it differently than I did before I made the deal. When I made the deal, I thought this was a great deal. After what happened to us, what happened to the world coming from China, I view it much differently. But we can impose massive tariffs on China if we want, and other countries, if we want.
Donald Trump: (01:01:12)
And we’ll see. We just want to be treated fairly. We want a level playing field. Our farmers were never treated properly by anybody, and they were targeted by China. I paid our farmers $28 billion over a two-year period, because they were targeted to that amount of money, to that exact amount of money. $28. They were $16 billion, and it was $12 billion, $28 over a two-year period, and we gave $28 billion to our farmers. That’s why they’re all here, and now they’re doing very well. Our farmers are doing very well, because we made really great trade deals. USMCA just kicked in. The China deal, they’re buying a lot. They are buying a lot, we’ll say that. They’re buying a lot. A lot of people ask, “How are they doing on the trade deal?” They’re buying a lot.
Donald Trump: (01:01:54)
So I want to thank everybody, and we’ll be having these conferences. Again, we’re going to be signing an immigration act very soon. It’s going to be based on merit. It’s going to be very strong. We’re going to work on DACA, because we want to make people happy. And I’ll tell you, even conservative Republicans want to see something happen with DACA. The Democrats had their chance for three years to do something with DACA, and they always turned it down. They always turned it down. They used it as politics. I’m using it to get something done, but we’ll be signing a very powerful immigration act. It’ll be great. It’ll be merit-based.
Donald Trump: (01:02:32)
The country’s tried to get it for 25 or 30 years. It’ll be strong on the border, but you’ll come in legally and you’ll be able to come in legally, and very importantly, we’ll be taking care of people from DACA in a very Republican way. Republicans, I’ve spoken to many Republicans, and some would like to leave it out. But really, they understand that it’s the right thing to do, so we’re going to be taking care of DACA. We will be doing for DACA what the Democrats had a chance to do and they never did it. Okay? Thank you all very much.
Press: (01:03:03)
[crosstalk 01:03:03] Florida, sir? What’s your advice to Governor DeSantis [crosstalk 01:03:17]-
Press: (01:03:17)
[crosstalk 01:03:17], Sir?
Press: (01:03:29)
Mr. President, a record number of deaths today in Florida. What are you advising Governor DeSantis to do? [crosstalk 01:03:29]."
"Jul 13, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:02)
Thank you all very much for being at the White House; very special house, very special place. I’m grateful to be joined by citizens whose lives have been saved by law enforcement heroes. And that’s what they are the heroes. And they’re being very unfairly treated over the last long period of time, but over the last few years. It’s terrible what’s happening. We’re also joined by two amazing officers, South Carolina Deputy Sheriff William Kimbro. Where’s William? William. William. What happened to William? Okay. That’s a good excuse. That’s good. And Palm Beach County, Deputy Sheriff Corey Reese. Hi Corey, good.
President Donald Trump: (00:55)
In recent weeks, our country’s police officers have been really under siege. I want to thank … First of all, I do want to thank Vice President Pence for all the work he’s done on this. And in particular Attorney General Bill Barr, because the job he’s done has been amazing. It’s been 24 hours a day, I guess I could say 28 hours a day, right? It never ends, but it’s been a great job that you both done. We appreciate it, Mike. We appreciate it very much. But our officers have been under vicious assault and hundreds of police have been injured and several murdered. You’ve been reading about it, just like I’ve been seeing it. Reckless politicians have defamed our law enforcement heroes as the enemy. They call them the enemy.
President Donald Trump: (01:42)
They actually go and say that they’re enemy and even call them an invading army. These radical politicians want to defund and abolish the police from our nation. At first, when I first heard it, I said, “Well, that’s just something that they’re saying.” But they actually are trying to do it. You look at what’s going on in Minneapolis. You look at what’s going on in many Democrat run areas, but they want to defund and they want to abolish. Far-left mayors are escalating the anti-cop crusade and violent crime is spiraling in their cities. It’s all far left cities where they have no understanding of what has to be done. They don’t have a clue. I will say that we put on a very powerful rule in law that you get 10 years, you’re knocked down a monument. If it’s a federal monument, you go to jail for 10 years.
President Donald Trump: (02:36)
If it’s anything else, we tell them we work with the states to help them. But if you do anything where it’s a federal monument and there are a lot of them up there and nobody’s been attacked, nothing’s been attacked since we did, 10 years in jail, monument or statue. In one recent week in New York City, this is hard to believe, shootings were up 358%. And yet they spend all their time, they want to do Black Lives Matter signs outside of Trump Tower. That ought to spend their time doing something else, because I’ll tell you what, 358% increase in shootings in New York. Last month, over 300 people were shot. NYPD retirements have quadrupled and they’re going up even further. And New York City is out of control. Unfortunately, my place, I love it, but it’s out of control. It was doing so well. Rudy Giuliani, whether you like Rudy or not, he did a great job. He was the greatest mayor in the history of New York. Murders in Atlanta up 133% compared to the same period last year. And one of the victims was an eight year old girl. Then we’ve had younger than that in Chicago last weekend. In the last two weeks, 105 Americans were shot in Philadelphia. In Minneapolis, the city voted to disband the police department and cut it way down, but disband it ultimately. The radical politicians are waging war on innocent Americans. That’s what you’re doing when you play with the police. My administration is pro-safety, pro-police and anti-crime. And I will say, I just see a new number came in from Chicago, this weekend was a scourge. This weekend was, I guess, 20 people killed in many, many shootings. Many, many shootings, far worse than the last week.
President Donald Trump: (04:25)
Things are happening that nobody’s ever seen happening happen. In cities that are liberally run, I call them radical lib, and yet they’ll go and march on areas and rip everything down in front of them. If that’s what you want for a country, you probably have to vote for sleepy Joe Biden, because he doesn’t know what’s happening, but you’re not going to have it with me. We’ve been very strong on law enforcement. We’ll be doing things that you’ll be, I think very impressed with. Numbers are going to be coming down even if we have to go in and take over cities because we can’t let that happen. When you have 20 people killed, 22 people killed in one weekend in Chicago. When you have 88 shootings, it’s not even conceivable. That’s worse than Afghanistan. I hate to say it. That’s worse than any war zone that we’re in, by a lot.
President Donald Trump: (05:19)
It makes them look like tame places by comparison so we’re not going to let it go on. Supposed to wait for them to call, but they don’t call. We’ve asked Chicago, ” Would you like us to go in and help?” And they don’t want to say anything. We’ve called many of the cities. “Would you like us to go and help?” We’ve done a great job in Portland. Portland was totally out of control and they went in and I guess we have many people right now in jail and we very much quelled it. And if it starts again, well quell it again, very easily. It’s not hard to do if you know what you’re doing. I just want to thank everybody for being here. I’ll maybe ask Vice President Pence to say a couple of words, and then I’d like Bill Barr to say something and we’ll go around the room. Okay? Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.
Vice President Mike Pence: (06:03)
Thank you, Mr. President. It’s a real privilege to be here with the law enforcement officers who are gathered here and families whose lives have been impacted so profoundly by the courageous efforts of men and women in law enforcement. I can assure you that while some are talking about defunding the police, under this President and this administration, we’re going to defend the police. We’re going to back the blue because we understand that while tragedies happen and we’ll always look for ways that we can improve public safety and the President’s taken steps and taken executive action to provide new resources to improve public safety and law enforcement around the country. I want to assure you that you have a president who knows what the people gathered around this table know, is that most of the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement every day are the best people in this country. They risked their lives every day to make a difference in our communities just like they’ve made a difference in all of your lives.
Vice President Mike Pence: (07:13)
I want to thank you all. I want to thank you for being here for this conversation as the American people will greatly benefit by being reminded of the incredible contributions that our law enforcement community makes each and every day. I appreciate your willingness to tell that story. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (07:34)
Thank you, Mike. Bill?
Attorney General Bill Barr: (07:37)
Thank you, Mr. President. First, let me say what an honor it is for me to serve under a president who is such a strong supporter of law enforcement. I’ve said repeatedly that to my mind, there is no more noble profession in our country than serving as a law enforcement officer. The police put their lives and wellbeing on the line every day for us and their jobs have never been more difficult than it is today. Today we suffer many unprecedented social ills; kids growing up without fathers, alienated young angry men, gangs engaged in the most brutal kinds of violence, increasing mental illness and homelessness and a drug epidemic, inflicting casualties beyond anything that we’ve experienced in a major war, and an increase in sexual assaults and child exploitation. You name it. And who is expected to deal with all of this? As other institutions fail and abdicate their responsibility, who is expected to stand their ground and pick up the pieces? The police are.
Attorney General Bill Barr: (08:56)
And that’s why I say their job, the job we ask them to do today, has never been more challenging. I believe it’s important to understand that just like any other institution, there’s always room for improvement. And over the past several decades, there’s unquestionably been a lot of progress and reforms in policing, that’s improved policing and life for the officers, their families, and their communities. We have the most professional police in the world. Now obviously, the event in Minneapolis was ghastly, and I haven’t heard anyone attempt to defend it. And it has rightly brought about an urge to make sure that we continue reforming and we finish the job. And I think that law enforcement understands and agrees that the concerns of the African American community regarding excessive use of force must be addressed, but we also have to be careful and not throw the baby out with the bath water.
Attorney General Bill Barr: (10:04)
And so extremist reactions like defund the police are trying to pull us in exactly the opposite direction of where we have to go. We have to give law enforcement more support, more training and resources. I think the executive order that the president signed last month strikes exactly the right balance. It’s supportive of the police and it also addresses legitimate concerns about excessive force. Our nation needs to gain a renewed appreciation of the noble work done by our police officers in protecting our communities. I thank the president for convening this round table, to highlight the good work done by our men and women in blue. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (10:52)
Thank you, Bill. I appreciate it. Maybe what we’ll do is we’ll go around the room and maybe you could introduce yourself and explain exactly what’s going on. You have an incredible story, please.
Camira Boyd: (11:04)
Hi, my name is Camira Boyd. I’m from Charleston, South Carolina. Well, on June 11, 2019, my baby started choking on breast milk. The first thing I started to do was just run out the house and jump in the car. While leaving out of my neighborhood, Officer Kimbro came. He was coming into the neighborhood and he immediately pulled me over and we immediately jumped out and he just took her from my arms and proceeded helping her. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (11:34)
Saved her.
Camira Boyd: (11:36)
Saved her.
President Donald Trump: (11:36)
Wow. You don’t hear those stories. That’s why I think it’s important to have a meeting like this. A little different. And it’s the meeting that we should have about a hundred times out of almost a hundred. This is the one because the police do such a job. And there’s an example. That’s fantastic. That’s fantastic. And did you know the gentleman on your left? Come on. Let’s go. Let’s tell that story please.
Camira Boyd: (12:07)
What do you mean?
President Donald Trump: (12:08)
Do you know? Do you want to go ahead? Please. Yes. Go ahead.
Officer William Kimbro: (12:11)
Mr. President, Vice President, Attorney General Barr, thank you for having us here. Other distinguished guests. My name is William Kimbro. I’m from Charleston, South Carolina. I worked for the Berkeley County Sheriff’s Office. As Camira was saying, on July 10th of 2019, while I was patrolling the unincorporated district of Somerville, South Carolina, I came across Camira and her grandmother speeding in the car. I conducted a traffic stop on that vehicle. And as soon as those vehicles stop, a lady, later identified, was it your grandmother Camira?
Camira Boyd: (12:47)
It was my step mom.
Officer William Kimbro: (12:48)
Oh, your stepmom, had jumped out of the vehicle and was frantic and said, “My baby, my baby, she can’t breathe.” And I kind of stepped back and I said, “What?” And the rest was captured on my body cam video that’s since gone viral. As soon as I stepped up to Camira, I instantly asked her for the baby, who is now my goddaughter and god-mom over there, Noni. Hi, Noni. Say hi, Noni. We’ve been blessed and it’s been a wonderful experience. Wonderful.
President Donald Trump: (13:26)
Great job.
Officer William Kimbro: (13:27)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (13:27)
Well, that’s what I meant when I kiddingly said … That’s what I meant when I kiddingly said, “Do you know the gentlemen to your left,” because you really know him.
Camira Boyd: (13:37)
Oh, okay.
President Donald Trump: (13:39)
That’s what I meant and great job you’ve done. Thank you very much on behalf of all of us. And Camira, congratulations.
Camira Boyd: (13:46)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (13:46)
Thank you for being here.
Camira Boyd: (13:46)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (13:48)
Thank you. Thank you both. Please, go ahead.
Sarah Bohan: (13:52)
It was about two weeks ago. I was laying in bed with my other three kids and … Well, I forgot to introduce myself, sorry. Sarah Bohan. We have four kids and we’re from…
Sarah Bohan: (14:03)
Forgot to introduce myself, sorry. Sarah [Bohan 00:14:02]. We have four kids and we’re from Roanoke, Virginia. I was laying in bed and my sister happened to be home and my husband ended up calling her and asking her to count how many kids were home and she got up and looked inside of my boy Spencer’s room and he was not there and his window was open, and so we instantly saw that he was missing, and he is autistic non-verbal and doesn’t really have a sense of danger. So when he goes missing, it’s like life or death, you got to find him as fast as you possibly can. So we instantly called the police and my husband rushed home from work and they called the search dogs out and within 12 minutes, they found him. He had ran up into the woods. Someone had spotted him sitting in the middle of the road and he pulled over and they tried to get him to come to him but of course he bolted and ran up into the woods and following behind the dog going in and out of the trees, it was actually really cool because I could imagine him doing that exact thing of going in and out of the trees and sliding down the creeks and I’m sure he was having the time of his life because he was free but we were able to find him and the dog’s ears perked up right when he was within 15 feet and I yelled his name and he sat down and instantly ran over to him and we were able to carry him back and he was safe and the only thing he had on him was four ticks, so he was good.
President Donald Trump: (15:46)
That’s great. So again, the police did a great job and the group did a great job and so Spencer has no sense of danger, so you would say basically he’s very brave, okay? View it that way. Thank you very much for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you. Brooke, please.
Brooke Rollins: (16:05)
Mr. President, thank you. I got to meet almost everyone. My name is Brooke Rollins. I have the extraordinary honor of serving this president as his domestic policy chief every day in this White House, and I will say there’s a lot of brave people in the room, probably no one more so than our two officers but this mom not only has, Mr. President, her nine-year-old here, but she has her four-year-old, her three-year-old, and her 10-month-old here and her husband Spencer just took them into the other room. So this is bravery at its finest for all the moms in the room who’ve sort of manhandled lots of children, so thank you for being here and certainly you two and that beautiful baby girl. What an honor to have you and all of you with us today. Mr. President, you mentioned New York City, Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia.
Brooke Rollins: (16:46)
The lack of leadership I think happening in some of our most ravaged cities around this country is really astonishing but I think it’s really important to note that that failure is a choice and it is a choice, Mr. President, that I know you would never make. I have seen you now more than two and a half years stand with law enforcement, stand with the mothers and the fathers in this country who are fighting for a chance at the American dream. That dream is not possible without a law enforcement that stands for the rule of law and for safe and secure communities, so thank you so much for your leadership. Everyone here today, thank you for coming. What an honor it is to have you in your house here at the White House on this day and special thanks to the moms who were brave enough to bring the little ones in to tell their story on behalf of these amazing men and women serving in blue. Thank you so much.
President Donald Trump: (17:37)
Well thank you very much Brooke. What’s more astonishing to me is that we’ll call, Bill will call, Vice President will call, I’ll call. You’ll call leaders of these cities, Democrat leaders, and we don’t care if they’re Democrat or not, they happen to be in every case, but we’ll call them and we’ll say, “Do you need help?” They’ll say, “No.” I said, “But you just had 40 people shot and many people killed this weekend.” They’ll say, “No, we’re okay.” I’ll say, “What’s that all about?” We’re tired of those answers. We’re tired of those answers, so thank you. To me that’s astonishing. Thank you very much Brooke. Please.
Kenneth Bearden: (18:14)
My name is Kenneth [Bearden 00:18:16], I’m from Louisville, Kentucky and I’m here today because I’m a man in recovery. At the age of 11 years old, I used substances for the first time and by the end of that summer I had overdosed seven times already. I’m one of them people that once I have put a modern mood-altering substance in my body I cannot stop. I did not stop using alcohol or drugs until the age of 24 and through that time at the age of 11 to 24, I have overdosed over 30 times and at least a dozen of them times I’ve had police officers there onsite, administering Narcan, saving my life and my son would not have his father today if it wasn’t for the police officers, the men and the women who administered that Narcan, and just that my son gets to have his dad today because of that and I get to help others along the way because of police officers, because of the people who have helped me along the way and I’m truly grateful to be here.
President Donald Trump: (19:44)
How are you doing now then? So that’s a lot of times that you had difficulty. How are you doing?
Kenneth Bearden: (19:48)
Yes. So I’ve got six years sober now –
President Donald Trump: (19:51)
Good.
Kenneth Bearden: (19:52)
I am one semester [inaudible 00:19:54] … I am one semester away from having my bachelor’s degree in social work.
President Donald Trump: (20:01)
Fun. Great.
Kenneth Bearden: (20:03)
I have a house. I have full custody of my son. I work for addiction recovery care as a community liaison helping other alcoholics and addicts get into recovery and providing support for them. I’m living my purpose and my passion.
President Donald Trump: (20:20)
That’s a fantastic job. Thank you very much. That’s an equally incredible statement, you understand what you’re doing now, so that’s great. Six years, almost six years. That’s fantastic.
Kenneth Bearden: (20:30)
[inaudible 00:20:30].
President Donald Trump: (20:30)
Good luck. We’ll see you … In let’s say celebrate in 10, okay, we’ll see you in 10.
Kenneth Bearden: (20:36)
Yes sir.
President Donald Trump: (20:36)
So we’ll see you in another four years, all right? That’s fantastic news. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Please.
Rhonda Norris: (20:44)
Good afternoon Mr. President. Thank you so much for having me here today.
President Donald Trump: (20:47)
Thank you.
Rhonda Norris: (20:47)
My name is Rhonda Norris. My story started when I was coming here from school one day. I teach and I was broad-sided in an intersection by a truck who ran a red light. I have no recollection of the accident. My first memory was a policeman reaching through the shattered window and checking for a pulse and I was in and out of consciousness and he continuously urged me to stay awake and stay with him. Very soothing, very calm, and he was calling on his radio for an ambulance and first responders which his being there sped up the process dramatically. He’s the one who told me we’re going to put a sheet over you to cut you out of the vehicle. I couldn’t move, I was trapped in the vehicle and also my injuries made me incapable of movement. He also followed the ambulance to the hospital. He gathered up all my personal belongings that he could find at the accident and brought them to my husband at the hospital and explained to him that I had regained consciousness. I stayed with my husband until the tests were done and they said she’s going to be okay.
Rhonda Norris: (22:03)
The most amazing thing to me about this state trooper is that he was off duty. He didn’t have to do any of that. He just happened to be at the scene of the accident and immediately responded and sped up my rescue and I’m eternally grateful to him for doing that.
President Donald Trump: (22:21)
Well that’s great. Thank you very much. It’s an incredible story. So how seriously … How long did it take to recover? How bad was it?
Rhonda Norris: (22:29)
I missed five weeks of work. I still have some injuries that will never go away but I am very, very thankful to be here.
President Donald Trump: (22:37)
Okay. That’s a great job. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Rhonda Norris: (22:40)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (22:40)
Thank you for being here. Please.
Perry Cleek: (22:44)
Mr. President, I’m Perry Cleek, pastor of Lighthouse Baptist Church in Jonesborough, Tennessee.
President Donald Trump: (22:51)
Good.
Perry Cleek: (22:51)
Our church watched over the last few weeks at the way that our police officers were treated all over the country and it was all over the news about how they are such … They’ve been demonized and disgraced and dishonored and we got our heads together and thought, “What can we do as a small church in a small town to honor our police and to let our voice be known?” Their voice is loud that blame all this on police officers. The voice of small town America is seldom heard, so we just set up a little ceremony. We went through the chief of police and the public safety director, and we asked them if we could hold a public ceremony on the steps of the courthouse on Main Street in Jonesboro on July 4 at 11:00 in the morning and present each member of the Jonesboro Police Department with a check for $1,000.00. We did that and it shouldn’t have but it made national news. I think small towns all over America feel like we do, that we want our voice to be heard that we love law enforcement, our local police officers, and if we can do something to support them and encourage them, then that’s what we want to do, and we feel very good about what we did.
President Donald Trump: (24:12)
Well that’s a great story. I thought you were going to tell me that they wanted to arrest you for giving them a couple of bucks and they deserve it very much but you know I’ve heard the other end of those stories also. You’re not allowed to do anything and you’re right about it. What the police have been going through over the last number of years in all fairness, it’s been starting but it’s never been like this, has it? It’s never been like this. It’s crazy. It’s crazy and they’ll find out it will go the opposite direction unfortunately at some point. It will go absolutely opposite when they see … You’re going to have some defunding and abolishing and you’ll see numbers like nobody would ever believe and they’re going to say, “Let’s get our police back as soon as we can.” That’s great what you just … That’s a fantastic thing.
Perry Cleek: (25:01)
Yes sir. We were thankful that it’s a small town and a small police department. It was only 23 employees so it wasn’t that big a hit.
President Donald Trump: (25:09)
That’s a lot.
Perry Cleek: (25:10)
But it was a blessing to be in.
President Donald Trump: (25:11)
That’s a lot. Good job. Thank you very much.
Perry Cleek: (25:14)
Mr. President, I’ve already heard. I’ve got a note written to the church that didn’t identify the officer but said I’m an 83-year-old widower and one of the officers brought by a sum of money and gave to me to put back to my utility bills this winter and told me it was a gift from Lighthouse Baptist Church. That’s what one officer and it was just a week ago, but that’s what one officer did with that gift that we gave.
President Donald Trump: (25:41)
That’s great. Great stories. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Debbie Wisner: (25:48)
Thank you Mr. President –
President Donald Trump: (25:49)
Thank you.
Debbie Wisner: (25:50)
And Mr. Vice President for having us. My name is Debbie [Wisner 00:25:54]. I’m local, I live in Maryland and my story is not very dramatic. It’s just one that my purse was stolen. My purse. People have it happen to them. My credit cards were canceled and my cellphone, we put a special note on it that said if found please call this number. Nothing came up then.
Debbie Wisner: (26:14)
A couple nights later in the middle of the night at midnight, the phone rings and a gentleman says, “I found your phone. I have your phone. Would you offer a reward for it?” I said, “Of course.” My husband said, “Are you nuts?” He said, “I’ll bring it to you.” I gave him my address and hung up the phone and called our police department. Because that’s who we turn to when there’s a situation. My husband had another idea. He wanted to do something else but I said, “No, we’re going to let the police do this. There’s no shooting tonight.” So the police came, they gave us their cellphone number, they went away around the corner and they said, “When he pulls up give us a ring. We’ll be there.” Sure enough, he pulled up, he comes out of the car, it’s 2:00 in the morning now, and the police, two squad cars were there immediately which is what we need in our communities and they checked him out. He did in fact find the phone and I gave him a reward and thanked my police officers and I’m grateful that we have community policemen that are willing to come at two in the morning and do this silly thing.
President Donald Trump: (27:32)
Yeah. That’s great. Thank you very much.
Debbie Wisner: (27:34)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (27:36)
Two in the morning. Why did he … That’s a strange time. So you found him to be okay? Even though he came at two in the morning?
Debbie Wisner: (27:41)
He came at two in the morning but so were our policemen.
President Donald Trump: (27:44)
Yeah, now they were there.
Debbie Wisner: (27:45)
That’s the only reason we were okay with it.
President Donald Trump: (27:48)
That’s great. Good. Thank you very much.
Debbie Wisner: (27:49)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (27:49)
Thank you. Really nice. Please.
Speaker 1: (27:54)
Mr. President, thank you so much. It’s an honor to be here. I like many others, we support you in supporting our law enforcement officers and providing safe communities.
Speaker 1: (28:03)
… supporting our law enforcement officers and providing safe communities. Thank you, Mr. Vice President for being here as well and your hard work and obviously, to the Attorney General. Attorney General Barr, thank you. To the law enforcement officers that are here and their families, and to your staff, Mr. President.
Speaker 1: (28:17)
Although it shouldn’t matter, Mr. President, I’m a kind of unique bird, if you will. I’m a Democrat, I am an elected official, I’m African American. I have 12 years experience in the Georgia House of Representatives, eight years as County Exec. As County Exec, I’ve had to manage a very large, probably one of the largest police departments in the state of Georgia, but I’ve also had the unfortunate experience of having to meet with family members who lost a loved one from a police shooting. That was probably the most difficult part of my job.
Speaker 1: (28:53)
But I’ve also had to deal on other side where I lost two police officers in one night among several others I lost. But, I lost two in one night. By the way, they happened to have been African American and going to meet with their family members as well, young wives with young babies and having to experience seeing them lose a loved one is nothing anybody would want to do.
Speaker 1: (29:18)
But I can tell you this, Mr. President, by and large, most law enforcement officers, those men and women who honorably wear their uniforms each and every day to go out when they’re running towards a situation, others are running from it, so we have to stand with them. I’ll say this, I have two words. We need more funding for police officers, not less funding and here’s why I say that. When you look at law enforcement and the equipment, that’s important for them because it’s to protect and save their lives as well as saving others lives. But clearly more money is needed to buy less lethal enforcement types of tools like the Bola, what they call the BolaWrap.
Speaker 1: (30:05)
We also need resources for them. Officers usually, almost always only get the psychological exam prior of being hired as part of the examination of getting hired. But afterwards, they’re not given those type of psychological exams or assessments. When you look at them, they’ve been on the, let’s say, the beat four or five years nonstop and the number of calls they’re getting, number of situations, that’s the way we can detect are they burnt out? Do we need to put him somewhere else? That’s important.
Speaker 1: (30:33)
Finally, Mr. President, community policing is important, that relationship, that trust being fair, but enforcing the law. Most people, including black people, they want law enforcement to be out there enforcing the law. I think they want them to be fair. They want them to be swift in justice. We lost a baby girl too in Atlanta, eight years old and it wasn’t to a police officer. More people have died from the protest of Black Lives Matter than prior to that.
Speaker 1: (31:07)
Sometimes it’s hypocritical because almost as if some Black lives matter, but all Black lives should matter and all lives should matter. I thank you, Mr. President, for what you’re doing-
President Donald Trump: (31:17)
Thank you.
Speaker 1: (31:17)
… and stand solidly with you.
President Donald Trump: (31:18)
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Beautiful. Please.
Susan Young: (31:23)
Good afternoon, President Trump, Vice President Pence and Mr. Barr and distinguished guests. I thank you for this opportunity to share our family’s story. Eight years ago, our 15-year-old daughter was trafficked by MS-13 gang members. She was trafficked over a year and a half time period throughout the DMV area. Law enforcement played a fundamental role in the rescue and the recovery of our daughter and were also vital in the protection and safety of our family, both then and now.
Susan Young: (32:01)
Initially the officer’s handling our case, albeit well-intentioned, we’re not trauma-informed and not able to differentiate a runaway team from a victim of human trafficking. Once we came in contact with trained personnel, former detective Bill Wolf, our situation improved. We need to provide resources and training to law enforcement to properly address not only the offenders, but also to the victims and to their families.
Susan Young: (32:35)
Because of Mr. Wolf’s expertise in this area, we were able to relocate our family to a safe location. We were able to get our daughter the proper resources and help so that she could heal and move on for her life. The law enforcement is crucial to the rescue, to the victims of human trafficking and I believe we should support them with everything we have. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (33:00)
Thank you very much. Great story. Thank you.
Ja’Ron Smith: (33:05)
Thanks so much, Mr. President, for convening this listening session and thank you for all the passion and being able to share your stories here on national TV with the President, because it’s really important. There’s so many people who don’t get a chance to have their voice lifted and having this opportunity to tell your story to a president that’s not only going to listen to it, but take action is extremely important to the work that we do.
Ja’Ron Smith: (33:33)
I want you all to know that as you go back home, we’re still there with you and we’re willing to come and do all we can to help create safer communities. Since day one, this president has been really focused on that in a unique way. I’ve spent some time on the road and with my colleague, Scott Turner, trying to get local leadership to work with us to not only change those communities, but empower people. But having these sessions here is extremely important because most people don’t know. Some people don’t know the pain that you all go through. Having that story be told to millions of people is extremely important.
Ja’Ron Smith: (34:15)
But I think what’s most important is that we take this session here and create action, work with our police department, empower our police department, empower our families so that we can change what’s happened over the last 20 years. There’s no reason for places across the country in America to have more deaths than a war over in Iraq or Afghanistan. That’s not the country that we’re about and this president won’t stand for it. Thank you so much-
President Donald Trump: (34:47)
Thank you.
Ja’Ron Smith: (34:48)
… Mr. President, for your leadership.
President Donald Trump: (34:50)
Thank you very much. You’re doing a great job too. Please.
Jo Etta Northcutt: (34:57)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m basically here in support of my daughter in-law and my grandchildren, but I would like to say a personal thank you to Officer Reece here for saving my grandson. I will never forget it and I’ll always be grateful. I would also like to add that I’m a state employee. I work in the city of Atlanta and I have seen a drastic change in law enforcement coverage in that area. I see the difference when law enforcement is not visible on the streets.
Jo Etta Northcutt: (35:37)
We’ve had our challenges there and it’s peaceful now, but when there is a lack of law enforcement within a community, civility breaks down and crime increases and I don’t have any answers to any solutions, but I can just speak on the fact that I have experienced it over the past three or four months. I thank you for your invitation here and for your time.
President Donald Trump: (36:08)
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Corey Reese: (36:14)
First of all, Mr. President, Vice President, Attorney General. Thank you very much for inviting me here today. It’s truly an honor to be here. I’m Deputy Corey Reece with Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. I have been a deputy there for going on three years now. Last month in June, I was staying with my wife at a Hampton Inn in Tampa, off duty, of course. I work in Palm Beach County, this is Tampa.
Corey Reese: (36:45)
We were in the room relaxing and I could hear a lady in the hallway screaming for help. I went outside and to see was going on and the young lady to my left here was on the floor, clutching the child in her arms. She was screaming for help. The child was crying and there was a man standing above them, grabbing at her and the child.
Corey Reese: (37:11)
Now, my first thought was it was a domestic situation, but clearly there was something going, something wasn’t right with the situation, so I separated him and she said that she doesn’t know him and he was trying to take her child and more and more people came pouring out of their rooms and were saying the same thing.
Corey Reese: (37:32)
I immediately got him separated. I had him sit down in the hallway and I had someone else call Tampa PD and they arrived. At that point, I just was keeping the peace between everybody because there was some people getting quite aggressive with him. It’s not the right time. You have to let law enforcement handle it. It’s not a time to take matters in your own hands.
Corey Reese: (37:58)
At that point it was mostly peacekeeping, but I didn’t think it would be as big of a deal as it ended up being until the next day some people in the hallway were like, “The video has gone viral. There’s a million views.” Then I’m getting a call saying I’m invited to the White House. I mean, it was completely unexpected. I was just doing what I was trained to do, what I was told to do, just being there, right time, right place and that’s it.
Corey Reese: (38:28)
Again, thank you for having me here.
President Donald Trump: (38:30)
It’s called natural instinct more than anything else. Thank you very much. Great job. Appreciate it.
Jakebia Northcutt: (38:35)
Hi, my name is Jakebia Northcutt and I want to thank you President and Vice President and everyone else for having me here. I want to thank you. I don’t know what I would have done [inaudible 00:38:59]. [inaudible 00:39:04]. He’s not too fun. He’s still dealing with it. I don’t really want to speak on the case because it’s still open, but the main thing I wanted to address is [inaudible 00:11:19].
President Donald Trump: (39:23)
Well, you’ve said it all. That’s a case that’s still going now? It’s still going?
Jakebia Northcutt: (39:27)
As far as with the law at the hotel.
President Donald Trump: (39:30)
I see.
Jakebia Northcutt: (39:30)
He entered our hotel room with a key in that he came in and tried to take him away.
President Donald Trump: (39:37)
Well, good luck with it.
Jakebia Northcutt: (39:39)
Excuse me.
President Donald Trump: (39:39)
Good luck. Beautiful guy too.
Jakebia Northcutt: (39:41)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (39:43)
Beautiful. That’s just a few stories of the thousands and thousands of stories that we could tell. We’ll probably be doing this again. But the police, they do a great job. They do a fantastic job and they don’t get the kind of … I will say this. The people of this country appreciate the police. They appreciate all they’ve done. You don’t see that if you watch the news. For the most part, you don’t see things like this, but they’ve done a fantastic job. Everybody here is a witness to that and we see it a lot.
President Donald Trump: (40:15)
The Attorney General sees it every day, but we see it a lot. I just want to thank the various police departments, law enforcement. They’ve done an incredible job in this country where they’re allowed to do their work, they really do a job. Thank you all very much for being here. Good luck with your case.
Jakebia Northcutt: (40:32)
Thank you, President.
President Donald Trump: (40:33)
Really, terrific job everybody. Terrific job. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (40:43)
Would anybody from the media like to ask anybody a question, up here? Steve, go ahead please.
Steve: (40:48)
Well, [inaudible 00:40:48] about if you’re at a good place with Dr. Fauci. There’s been some criticism of him over the last couple of days. Do you still appreciate his advice?
President Donald Trump: (40:57)
Well, I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci. I’ve had for a long time, right from the beginning. I find him to be a very nice person. I don’t always agree with him. I closed the border, as you know, to China. I closed. I did the ban on China, heavily infected and we saved tens of thousands of lives and Dr. Fauci will admit that it was a good decision. It was very early. That was in January, long before it was thought of as the right thing to do.
President Donald Trump: (41:24)
I also closed the borders to Europe when Italy and a couple of other countries over there, France, certainly Spain, they were having a lot of problems. I closed the borders very early, shortly after I did with China. We saved a lot of lives. We’ve made a lot of good decisions. But no, I get along with him very well. I like him personally. Please.
Reporter: (41:42)
Mr. President, are you going to pardon Michael Flynn?
President Donald Trump: (41:48)
I can’t hear you.
Reporter: (41:48)
Are you going to pardon Michael Flynn?
President Donald Trump: (41:49)
Well, he’s got a case going on right now. I don’t know this for a fact, but I think he’s doing very well with respect to his case. I hope that he’s going to be able to win it and I don’t have a decision to make until I find out what’s going to happen. But I think-
President Donald Trump: (42:03)
And I don’t have a decision to make until I find out what’s going to happen. But I think he was persecuted. He didn’t lie. It turned out he didn’t lie. The FBI said he didn’t lie. I think he was persecuted. And nobody understands what’s going on with the judge, the Justice Department, which is so capable. They decided to take a view on it and they decided that he should be… they were going to drop the case. So he’s right now, meaning his lawyers and him, are embroiled in hopefully the final stages of what should have never happened. They treated him very unfairly, as they have many people on this side. Yeah, please.
Susan Young: (42:40)
President Trump, you’ve said many times that the number of coronavirus cases is going up because testing is increasing.
President Donald Trump: (42:46)
That’s right.
Susan Young: (42:47)
Do you acknowledge that it’s going up for other reasons, too, for example, that it’s actually spreading and what are you going to do to stop the spread?
President Donald Trump: (42:55)
You know that we have one of the lowest mortality rates anywhere. If you know Biden and Obama stopped their testing, they just stopped it. You probably know that. I’m sure you don’t want to report it, but they stopped testing right in the middle. They just went, “No more testing,” and on a much lesser problem than the problem that we have, obviously, with respect to… this is the worst thing that’s happened since probably 1917. This is very bad. All over the world, there’s 188 countries right now.
President Donald Trump: (43:27)
But no, we test more than anybody by far. And when you test, you create cases. So we’ve created cases. I can tell you some countries they test when somebody walks into a hospital sick or walks into maybe a doctor’s office, but usually a hospital, that’s the testing they do, so they don’t have cases, whereas we do. We have all of these cases, so it’s a double edged sword. At the same time, we have the lowest mortality or just about the lowest mortality in the world. We’re doing a great job. We’re doing very well with vaccines and we’re doing very, very well with therapeutics. And I think we’re going to have some very good information coming out soon.
President Donald Trump: (44:05)
But we have the best and certainly the biggest, by far the biggest testing program anywhere in the world. If you tested China or Russia or any of the larger countries, if you tested India, as an example, the way we test you’d see numbers that would be very surprising. Brazil too. Brazil is going through a big problem, but they don’t do testing like we do. We do the testing and by doing the testing, we have tremendous numbers of cases. If we didn’t do this… as an example, we’ve done 45 million tests. If we did half that number, you’d have half the cases probably around that number. If we did another half of that, you’d have half the numbers. Everyone would be saying, “Oh, we’re doing so well on cases.”
President Donald Trump: (44:53)
But when I see it reported in the night, you can check me out of this. I mean, they always talk about… they’re always talking about cases, the number of cases. Well, it is a big factor that we do. We have a lot of cases because we have a lot of testing, far more than any other country in the world. And it’s also the best testing. Yeah. Please.
Speaker 2: (45:14)
The federal government set to resume federal executions for the first time in more than a decade, potentially as soon as a couple of hours from now. Are you monitoring the last minute appeals on that case? [crosstalk 00:45:22]
President Donald Trump: (45:21)
Well, I think what I’m going to do is allow that to be answered by our Attorney General. Do you mind, Bill?
Attorney General Bill Barr: (45:29)
Yes, sir. We obviously monitor the appellate process.
Speaker 2: (45:34)
And Mr. President, have you given any consideration to using your clemency powers to stop these executions and commute them to life sentences?
President Donald Trump: (45:39)
Well, I’ve looked at it very strongly. And in this particular case, I’m dealing with Bill and all of the people at Justice. And it’s always tough. You’re talking about the death penalty, but when you talk about people that did what this particular person did, that’s tough also. We’re going to see what happens. Right now they have a stay, I believe, right? They have a stay and we’ll let the courts determine the final outcome and that’s what’s going to happen. Okay.
Speaker 3: (46:05)
[inaudible 00:46:05] Sir, you’re asking Americans to have full faith in law enforcement. How do you respond to critics who say you undermined your own federal law enforcement agency, the DOJ, when you commuted the sentence of Roger Stone?
President Donald Trump: (46:20)
Well, if you look back on it, this was an investigation that should have never taken place. You have guys like Comey, you have McCabe, you have Strzok, you have his lover, Lisa Page, you have all of these people running around, you have Brennan and Clapper who lied to Congress, you have many, many people, you have people that change documents going into the FISA Courts, and it’s a terrible thing. And this is an investigation that they said should have ended before it started. It shouldn’t have started, and if it did, it should have ended immediately because they found, as you know, as well as I do, they found nothing initially, but it went on for two years or longer.
President Donald Trump: (47:03)
And no, I did. I’m getting rave reviews for what I did for Roger Stone. And he frankly, is going to go and now appeal his case. He had a jury forewoman who hated Roger Stone and who hated probably me, but she went on a false pretense and he wasn’t given a fair trial. He wasn’t. It’s not a fair trial. He wasn’t given another trial. He should have been given another trial. I won’t say more. I won’t talk about the judge. I’m not going to. Why would I ever talk about a judge? But this was a judge that gave, I believe solitary confinement to Paul Manafort. Al Capone didn’t have solitary confinement. These are things that happened. And if you look at President Bush, President Clinton, President Obama, take a look at what they did.
President Donald Trump: (47:51)
Frankly, it’s very unfair Roger Stone was treated very unfairly in my opinion. And so were many others this side. In the meantime, you have the other ones who are admitted lying before… they admitted they lied before Congress, they leaked classified information, which is something you just can’t do. And what are they doing? We’ll see what happens, but no, we’re we’re getting rave reviews for what I did. Okay.
Speaker 4: (48:17)
Are you going to be able to hold the convention in Jacksonville with all this virus spread?
President Donald Trump: (48:22)
Well, we’re going to see it built up a little bit, but we’re going to do something that will be great. We think we’re doing very well. We had some poll numbers a little while ago that a great. It’s the same story. It’s a suppression polls that we had in 2016, phony polls. Fake news, phony polls, same thing. And we’re doing very well. We’re doing well in Georgia.
President Donald Trump: (48:41)
We’re doing well in Texas. I read where I was one point up in Texas. I’m not one point up in Texas. We’re many points up. I saved the oil industry. Two months ago, I saved the oil industry. There would have been… I created it. We became number one, we have millions of jobs and we saved it. Texas is not going to have to let go of millions and millions of people. Oklahoma, North Dakota, many states. We’re $40 a barrel. And yet you can buy gasoline for under $2. Nobody’s ever seen like this. We have the biggest energy in the world. When number one oil as you know, oil and gas by far. We’re now number one in the world. And we would have had millions of people out of work. I saved it. And then they say I’m leading by one point in Texas. They said it last time too. They said, Texas is too close to call. This was like three months before the election. And then I won Texas in a blow out. They called it the minute the polls closed.
President Donald Trump: (49:38)
They said that about Utah. They said that about Georgia. They said the same thing, that Georgia is, “Oh, we can’t, it’s too close. They’ll never be able to determine. We’ll have to wait until election night.” On election night, two seconds after the poll closed, they called Georgia. It’s the same thing. And we have the same thing. They’re phony polls. They’re suppression polls. But to think that after saving the oil and gas business and millions and millions of jobs, I’m leading Texas by one point. I don’t think so. Go ahead.
Speaker 5: (50:07)
Is the China phase one deal is still intact or is it… or do you see it in jeopardy?
President Donald Trump: (50:11)
It’s intact. It’s intact, but I think what China has done to the world with what took place, the China plague, you call it the China virus, you can call it whatever you want to call it. It’s about 20 different names. What they did to the world should not be forgotten. But it’s intact. They’re buying. Whether they buy or not, that’s up to them. They’re buying.
Speaker 6: (50:40)
President, Los Angeles just announced that they are delaying the opening of their schools. New York already said they were going to delay them. Other school districts are giving parents the choice whether to send their kids to school or not. What do you tell parents who look at this, who look at Arizona where a school teacher recently died teaching summer school, parents who are worried about the safety of their children in public schools?
President Donald Trump: (51:00)
Yeah. The school should be opened. Schools should be opened. Kids want to go to school. You’re losing a lot of lives by keeping things closed. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. We saved millions of lives while we did the initial closure. Had we not done what we did, we would’ve had two to … Mike and I were talking about it before 2 to 3 million lives lost, but we did that. We’re at about 135,000 and we’ll be somewhat higher than that by the time it ends. And again, the vaccines are happening and the therapeutics are happening, but I’m not even talking about that. We’ll be at a somewhat high, but we would have lost 2 million, 3 million lives had we not done it.
President Donald Trump: (51:43)
Now we understand it also. We understand there are certain vulnerabilities, young children. I was with, talking to Governor Murphy and they have thousands of lives, I won’t even say how many, just thousands of lives, hard to believe in New Jersey. And he said there was only one life that was 18 or younger, one person died. And that was a person, a young man that had some medical difficulty. When you think of that with thousands of lives and you have one person that was under 18, that’s something, that tells you for some reason, I guess, the immune system is much stronger with young people than it is for others. We have to watch the group that does have the difficulty, does have the problem. We all know what that is. We all know who they are, especially if they have a medical problem. If they have a medical problem, diabetes or heart or anything, it’s a big problem.
President Donald Trump: (52:38)
But we’re being very careful, but we have to open the schools. Would you agree with that? Do you agree? Yeah. We have to open the schools. We have to get them open. And I think there’s a lot of politics going along. I think they think they’ll do better if they can keep the schools closed in the election. I don’t think it’s going to help them, frankly. But I think they feel that by keeping schools closed, that’s a bad thing for the country and therefore that’s a good thing for them. But they’re the ones who city’s burning. I mean, can you imagine if the country was run like Chicago and like New York and like some of these other Democrat super radical left cities are run. You wouldn’t have a country for very long and the economy would crash.
President Donald Trump: (53:22)
We just set a brand new record today on NASDAQ again. This is now I think the 18th time since, and this has since… after the problems. We have a new stock market high for NASDAQ, and the other ones are getting very close. When I came here, the stock market was up almost 500 points today. The economy is rebuilding. Jobs are being produced at a record pace. We’ve never had a pace like this. And I will tell you if Biden got in, this economy would be destroyed. He was in office for 48 years, and what he did was not great. Almost every decision was a wrong decision. And now he’s going to come in and try and help us. We didn’t need any help. We built the greatest economy in history, greatest economy we’ve ever had, the greatest economy the world has ever seen. And then the plague came in from China and we started… we did the right thing. We had to close it down. Now we’re opening it up. He can’t do it. He doesn’t have the capability to do it.
President Donald Trump: (54:20)
Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Good luck with everything. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it."
"Jul 10, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:09)
Hello, everybody. We’re going to Miami. We’re going to different parts of Florida today. We’ll be back at about 11 o’clock tonight, and a lot of stops, a lot of very good stuff. We look forward to it. Tropical storm Fay is probably going to be hitting a place called New Jersey, a good place, pretty soon. We are on the watch. We are fully prepared. FEMA’s ready in case it’s bad. It shouldn’t be too bad, but you never know. You never know, but at this moment it’s looking like it’s going to be hitting New Jersey fairly soon. We are fully prepared and other than that, I’ll see you in Miami. Okay? Thank you.
Reporters: (00:50)
Are you considering [inaudible 00:00:49]?
Donald Trump: (00:50)
Say it?
Reporters: (00:51)
What did Joe Biden say?
Donald Trump: (00:55)
He plagiarized from me, but he can never pull it off. He likes to plagiarizing. It’s a plan that is very radical left, but he said the right things because he’s copping what I’ve done. The difference is he can’t do it and he knows he’s not doing that. He can’t be the same because he’s raising taxes way too much. He’s raising everybody’s taxes. He’s also putting tremendous amounts of regulations back on. Those two things are two primary reasons that I created the greatest economy we’ve ever had. Now we’re creating it again. Okay?
Reporters: (01:30)
Are you considering pardoning Roger Stone?
Donald Trump: (01:33)
Well, I’ll be looking at it. I think Roger Stone was very unfairly treated as were many people. In the meantime, Comey and all these guys are walking around including Biden and Obama because we caught them spying on my campaign. Who would have believed that one? Thank you."
"Jul 10, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:00)
But thank you very much. Great job. And he recovered successfully. He was positive. He tested positive. I heard about it. I wasn’t thrilled, but he fought it out. Somebody said his immune system must’ve been good. It wasn’t perfect, but you still went through a little bit, right?
Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart: (00:15)
I did.
Speaker 1: (00:16)
But you did a great job. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (00:19)
Well, my administration as you know, it stands with every citizen of Venezuelan and Cuban, Nicaragua. It stands with the righteous struggle for freedom. The patriots here today fled socialism to find freedom and socialism and other things, as you know, and a step beyond socialism in many cases. And now Joe Biden and the radical left are trying to impose the same system, socialism plus, in America. Biden is a puppet of Bernie Sanders, AOC, the militant left, the people that want to rip down statues and monuments to George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Jesus. Jesus. They want to rip down statues to Jesus. So we’re dealing with a group of people that they will not win. They will not win at all.
President Donald Trump: (01:11)
But this election coming up is a very important one. I used to say 2016, the most important. And maybe I’ll still say that, but this is equal to that. This is equal because we need that extra time to have it seed. Like a tree, you move it, it has to grab on. And that’s why I appreciate you’re all being your great leaders. And I appreciate you being here. Nobody will be safe in a Biden America, but Biden doesn’t know what a Biden America is. If you asked him to define it, he wouldn’t even know what it is, but other people do. And he will have radical people running that. He’ll be choosing a vice president who, we’ll see what that ends up being, but he’ll be choosing somebody. But even that person won’t have as much to do with running the country as you’d believe.
President Donald Trump: (01:58)
Biden wants to defund the police. He wants to call the cops the enemy, which he did the other day leaving every citizen at the mercy of a socialist mob or a mob far worse than socialism was ever meant to be. I’m fighting against this horrible situation. I’m fighting and I’m fighting hard. And I want the Republicans to get strong and tough. And I want people that agree with me on the Democrat side, of which there are many, I think we’re going to have a tremendous Democrat surge. In the real polls, we’re doing very well. We reviewed polls this morning with different states. We’re doing very well.
President Donald Trump: (02:37)
By the way, you’ll be happy to know in the state of Florida, we’re doing great. You see the boaters out there, thousands and thousands of boats every weekend. And we appreciate it, but nobody’s seen anything like it ever. And we have that in many other states with boaters and bikers and everybody. There’s a spirit that nobody’s ever seen. I don’t think we had anything like this even in the 2016 race because they see what happened. We built the greatest economy in the history of our world. Greater than anything we’ve had, but greater than anything the world has ever seen. China was not doing well. China went down to the worst. It was the worst year they had in 67 years. This is before the plague came into China, virus came in. And the worst economy they had in 67 years. They were doing not well with the tariffs and all the other. We’re taking billions of dollars from China. I was giving it to farmers and giving it to people that were targeted. And we were doing great and then the plague came in. I said, “Oh, there’s the plague. The plague is coming in.” And we closed our borders to China, very heavily infected. And we did the ban. And if we didn’t do that, we would have had hundreds of thousands of more people dead. And then we did the ban to Europe because we saw what was happening with Italy and Spain and some others, many others. And we were ahead. But we’re still fighting it, and we’re going to do very well. We’re testing at a level that nobody’s ever tested before. We’re making ventilators for the world. We literally had no ventilators and now we’re making thousands of ventilators a month. Thousands, thousands, and thousands. And we’re helping other countries.
President Donald Trump: (04:13)
We’re giving, as an example, to Mexico. We’ve given 600 ventilators and they desperately needed them. The president of Mexico was up at the White House two days ago and he is a great guy, the president. We had a tremendous day and evening. We had dinner with a lot of the real leadership of Mexico and it was a fantastic thing. And a lot of people didn’t think we would get along and it was just the opposite. We were joking about it a little bit. People thought maybe we’re very different type people, but we’re not really. We got along great. So the relationship with Mexico and the United States is very strong. We just signed the USMCA, which is tremendous. We had a horrible, horrible situation with NAFTA. It was the worst trade deal I think probably ever made. And now we have a great trade deal for the United States that also it’s very fair to Canada and to Mexico. So that’s good.
President Donald Trump: (05:10)
We imposed historic sanctions on the Maduro regime. We indicted Maduro for narco terrorism as you know, everybody here knows. We’re standing with the righteous and rightful leaders of Venezuela. This time it Juan Guaido. We impose sanctions on Nicaragua for human rights violations. They’ve been violating a lot of human rights. A lot of very bad things are happening in Nicaragua. And I ended the Obama-Biden sellout to the Castro regime in Cuba. We’ve been very strong on Cuba. Cuba is not doing so well. Joe Biden has pledged to reinstate the pro-communist policies of the Obama-Biden administration. They were pro-communist policies. The deal we made with Cuba was ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. What he did for Cuba and what they did for Cuba is ridiculous. And I guess it’s why the Cubans gave me the Bay of Pigs Award just before the last election. If you remember, I got the Bay of Pigs Award, which was a great honor. I have it very proudly in my office.
President Donald Trump: (06:16)
Republicans are the party of freedom. Democrats are the party of socialism and worse that’s what’s happened. The Democrat party is a whole different deal. They tear down the monuments and they think it’s good. Nancy Pelosi made the statement, “Well, that’s okay. That’s no big deal.” And the reason she said that she has no control over it. She didn’t say it because she really believed it. She said it because she has absolutely no control over what these people are doing and we do. We do. We were going to go into Seattle. We were all set to move and then they heard that we were and the police came out and they did what they should have done weeks before. So we got that done.
President Donald Trump: (06:55)
Minneapolis, same thing. We said, “You got to send in the national guards after four days of ridiculous, no law enforcement.” We demanded that the National Guard be sent in, and the minute it was sent in, it all ended. They walked through the streets like a knife goes through butter. It was pretty amazing. Now what we’re doing is in Portland, we have a very radicalized group and we have it so under control. We have an under control. The local police have not done the job. I think they were told not to do a job, but we have it very much under control. We’re taking very strong measures and we’re looking at other places too. When you see what’s going on in some of these Democrat run cities, all Democrat run cities in every case, and they’re to hell. And we’re doing a lot of things to get that changed. And we’re going to get it changed very quickly.
President Donald Trump: (07:49)
So I’d like to ask our great Congressman to say a few words if he would. He understands the situation. He loves this area very much. He will constantly call me. And if I can’t get back to him immediately, he’ll call me again because he wants money coming here and he wants a lot of other things coming here. And that’s the way a good Congressman supposed to be. Right? And he’s not a good Congressman, he’s a great Congressman. So if you would please, Mario.
Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart: (08:14)
Mr. President, thank you. If I ever can’t get ahold of you, I then harass Mark Meadows who’s was an amazing, an amazing asset to our country. So let me first to our friends here, the president, we just came back from SOUTHCOM. All of us in this community have known, Mr. President, for years that there’s drugs coming in that out people see coming in. And yet, because of lack of assets, frankly, lack of leadership, not supplying the assets, we can’t stop them. And so this president has done this surge to SOUTHCOM to stop those narcotics from coming in. And I don’t know of anything that could be done as quickly to actually save American lives as the initiative that the president has started a little while ago, and it’s already bearing fruit. So Mr. President, thank you for visiting the heroes here at Southern Command, but more importantly for recognizing a threat to our national security and to the lives of our people and confronting it not with lip service, but with action. So first, I want to thank you for that.
Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart: (09:28)
Second, we’re here with friends who understand, unfortunately, what socialism is all about. We have a daughter of a martyr who was murdered by the Castro regime. We have individuals here who understand that the situation in Venezuela, in Nicaragua and in Cuba is not only disastrous for those people, but as you have stated so many times, it is a danger, a threat to the national security interests of the United States. I said it before that this administration has emphasized this hemisphere, but it’s emphasized it in support for the cause of freedom, not solidarity with those who repress their people. It has shown solidarity with the people, not the oppressors of those people by what the president just talked about sanctions and tough pressure and diplomacy and leadership.
Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart: (10:31)
Mr. President, on behalf of the folks that I represent and I’m honored to represent, thank you. Those actions are not small. The impact on our national security is huge. The impact on the millions of people who are suffering who now have hope is a measurable history rule record you as the president who freed this hemisphere from communism and socialism. Those regimes will not last another four years of President Trump. I’m convinced of it. And you’ve seen that others are saying, “Oh, we’re going to go back to the policy of recognizing, legitimizing.” Legitimizing the Castro regime knowing what they’re doing in Venezuela and in Nicaragua and in the hemisphere. That’s unacceptable. So I just, again, on behalf of the folks that I represent, thank you for standing up for our national security interest, for freedom and for your solidarity for those who are working and struggling and in many cases dying just to regain their freedoms. Thank you, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (11:50)
Thank you very much, Mario. Appreciate it. Great job you do. How about we go down the line, please.
Ernesto Ackerman: (12:01)
Thank you President Trump for having me here today and letting me express my feelings about my homeland, Venezuela. I am proud to be here with so many prominent friends, Orlando, John, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, [foreign language 00:12:19].
Ernesto Ackerman: (12:23)
My name is Ernesto Ackerman. I’m the president of Independent Venezuelan American Citizens, more known as IVAC. My organization has worked over 18 years very hard lobbying in favor of Venezuelans in Congress of the US. And we were the first ones to work with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and my congressional brother, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart to achieve the law of sanctions against the narco terrorists in Venezuela. I am the son of a concentration camp survival. She is currently 96, 97 years old living still in Venezuela. I think that she feels that she is again reliving her time in a concentration camp. I left Venezuela in 1989, and only 45 days after the rallies that were called El Caracazo, very similar to what happened here some weeks ago. The excuse in Venezuela was gasoline. Was it here, George Floyd?
Ernesto Ackerman: (13:36)
Then in 1998 came the elections and Chavez was elected president of Venezuela. They started by controlling the weapons and ammunition that people could have. Is that similar to eliminate our Second Amendment? Then came changes in the police. For example, all the police in the municipalities, [foreign language 00:13:58] as an example, became [foreign language 00:14:03], and the [foreign language 00:14:04]. Is that what means defend the police? Then from being the richest country in the region, today we are the poorest. No medicine, no food, and somethings so essential like drinking water. That is what socialism brings to our nation.
Ernesto Ackerman: (14:27)
I became a citizen of this great country in the year 2000. I have a wonderful wife, three daughters, one of which is an ex police officer, and four grandchild. What future would they have in socialism? That is why, Mr. President, being a proud American, I will work hard to prevent socialism from penetrating this great country and count with me to support, to achieve it. Mr. President, that’s why today I want to make you two requests. First, that we eliminate the germ of socialism from this, it’s essence in Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, et cetera. And second, help the people of Venezuela to get rid of the narco terrorists who have kidnapped our nation. They alone cannot do it. The countries of the region must have a greater participation since they are also affected by this situation. Your leadership is necessary to fulfill this goal. Thank you, Mr. President, and I am working for you for more four years.
President Donald Trump: (15:40)
That’s very nice. I appreciate it. Beautifully said. And it is a catastrophe when you think of what happened to Venezuela. Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: (15:48)
Thank you, Mr. President. It’s an honor to be here with you and to hear these stories on why the fight for freedom can never be forgotten. Mr. President, your-
Speaker 2: (16:03)
Can never be forgotten. Mr. President, your campaign and the Republican National Committee are building the largest grassroots movement in American history because of you and your steadfast commitment to always put America first for every American. The Republican party is growing by the day because Americans know that you’re standing up for our freedoms and what makes America great no matter the criticism. And because of that, the Republican party is now the party of freedom thanks to you. As we say here, [foreign language 00:00:41]. We’re the party of freedom because we stand for freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom for the unborn, freedom of commerce if it’s free, fair, and reciprocal trade, freedom at home and abroad. The Hispanic and Latino community in Florida knows the horrors of life without freedom. They’ve seen firsthand how leaders who value control, not freedom, destroy prosperity, security, and opportunity.
Speaker 2: (17:19)
That’s what happened in Venezuela, in Cuba and Nicaragua. That’s what socialism does. Mr. President, freedom and faith in America are now threatened by the same radical left ideology seen in places like Cuba and Venezuela as that ideology now controls today’s Democrat party. And the only protector of our American freedom and American greatness is you Mr. President. That’s why everyone around this table and the communities outside of this church are working hard every day to reelect you as our president for four more years. We’re registering voters, we’re knocking doors, we’re sharing this Republican message of freedom in English and Spanish telling folks why you need four more years for America Mr. President.
Speaker 2: (18:21)
When you declared before our union, that America will never be a socialist country, the words made clear to freedom-loving people across our hemisphere that you stand with those who love freedom and the community here in Doral knows that. Thank you for standing up for America, for standing up for our freedom, for our greatness. Only you can rebuild the economy, this economy to secure our safety and prosperity for future Americans. American saw historic low unemployment for every community across America under your leadership, including Hispanic and Black Americans, and with God’s help and with your leadership, we know that the best is yet to come. Thank you for your time today Mr. President and thank you to all the great leaders at this table.
President Donald Trump: (19:19)
I want to get that speech. Do you mind giving me that speech? I could use it. How good was this? Who’s your speechwriter? You write that yourself? You want to work for me as a nice speech writer. [crosstalk 00:19:31] He’s too big. He works for me anyway in a different way, but you’ve done a great job. That’s a beautiful speech. I want to thank you very much.
Speaker 3: (19:38)
That’s true.
President Donald Trump: (19:39)
I want it. You think I’m kidding too, don’t you? He thinks I’m kidding. It’s true the Republican party has grown incredibly from where it was and we have a whole different group of people in the Republican party. People don’t remember, nobody ever heard of it until I came along. Nobody remembered it for a long time or they didn’t use it, at least I use it all the time. Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. You say that people say. I didn’t know that. But he was a Republican. So we’re doing a great job, but that’s beautiful job. I appreciate it very much. Thank you. Please.
Orlando: (20:15)
Sir. My name is Orlando Gutierrez Boronat. I represent the Assembly of the Cuban Resistance. It’s the main coalition of port democracy organizations in the Cuban exile community. And what I want to do is very briefly share with you four memories of my life that helped me understand what socialism is or communism is.
President Donald Trump: (20:32)
Okay.
Orlando: (20:34)
First of all, I want to thank God for this opportunity for many different reasons. And it brings back one of my clearest memories of Cuba which was sitting in one of those big, beautiful Havana churches and the church was almost empty. My grandmother and myself, two or three more people, the priest doing mass, people were afraid to worship, people were afraid to go to church. Because they would put mobs outside to insult you, when you came in or when you walked out and you will be discriminated if you believed in God, persecuted. [inaudible 00:21:00] family knows that experience very well. And every war communism and socialism have come, to the first freedom they strike out as religious freedom. Why are they knocking down the statues of Jesus? Because they’ve done it everywhere they’ve gone. Whether it’s a synagogue, a temple, a church, that’s their target. St. Augustine said that the source of all other freedoms was religious freedom.
Orlando: (21:21)
The right to believe, or not to believe, to have faith, or not to have faith, that’s fundamental. And that’s one of the first things communism in Cuba tried to eradicate. They tried to wipe out Christianity in Cuba. For this very powerful reason and for many others, free Cubans, Cuban Americans have been at the forefront of the struggle against communism, in Cuba and around the world. Thousands of Cubans have died in that struggle. Thousands have been imprisoned. Many are still in prison today. It’s been a very long struggle and this community has been visited many times by different leaders who made a lot of promises. Few of those promises, the most glaring being the Bay of Pigs, have been kept. And that’s why one of the reasons why I thank God for being here is that I wanted the opportunity to thank you. Because you came through. I was there when they gave you the Bay of Pigs award. I was one of the speakers at that day. I was honored to do.
Orlando: (22:14)
And what you said that day, what you’ve been working on ever since, closely with Mario whose untiring relentless struggle for human freedom, you’ve come through. And Cubans have been without a homeland for so long. We’ve been in this struggle for so long that one of the things we cherish is loyalty and gratitude and we are grateful to you. And we’re good friends to have because once someone has served the cause of freedom in Cuba and behaved like you have, we will be loyal to you forever. Title three, title four have empowered Cubans legally to fight for justice. The strategic sanctions aimed at the military and the intelligence and security sectors have weakened them. That’s why we’ve seen in the past months and the past few weeks protests against this regime in Santa Clara and more [inaudible 00:07:03], in key cities in Cuba.
Orlando: (23:04)
Every time Cubans see that the state is weakened and they have a chance to fight, they fight. They go out and they struggle. That’s why it’s especially important at this point in time that we have a strong Radio Marti, a strong TV Marti, a strong [foreign language 00:07:16], all these stations which are transmitting uncensored, accurate objective information to Cubans. Cuba is the base for the communist occupation of Venezuela and Nicaragua. If Cubans are really supported like you’re doing now to free Cuba, the entire hemisphere will breathe better, including the United States.
Orlando: (23:37)
The second memory I want to share with you is that right before we left Cuba, my parents spent five years trying to get out of Cuba. My father for the crime of being an electrical engineer, they didn’t want to let him go. So we had to go to a work camp, et cetera, et cetera. A few days before leaving my father took me to different places in Havana to show me Havana before we left because he said, “We may never come here again,” and he never returned, he never saw his city again. And Havana was a beautiful city. It’s been destroyed now by communism. And it’s a beautiful city because between 1902 and 1959, in less than 60 years, Cubans took that island from being devastated by genocide and Spanish occupation to being one of the leading Latin American countries, with a thriving economy. Just to give you an example which nobody ever discusses, before 1959, Cuba fed itself and exported food to the entire hemisphere. Cuba today cannot feed itself without US donations of food.
Orlando: (24:33)
So we have lived firsthand what you are struggling against. Those many in media and in Hollywood who spread lies about socialism, lies about communism, lies about what happened in Cuba. People are naive about socialism. They’re naive about communism. Che Guevara himself said that the goal of communism and socialism was to destroy the individual, to destroy individualism. That’s the engine of freedom. That’s the engine of prosperity. Compare Cuba today with Israel or with Taiwan. And by the way, this community also thanks you for your support for Israel and Taiwan. Look how those countries are doing. Same size, very similar to Cuba. They’ve prospered. Cuba has collapsed.
Orlando: (25:14)
So my last memory is the 24th of February of 1996. Four Cuban Americans were massacred over international airspace, trying to help people who were escaping Cuban refs. We are to consider the indictment of Raul Castro for for that massacre and that the regime be tried at an international tribunal, at Cuban Nuremberg for the crimes against humanity like that massacre and many others that it has committed. That regime must be removed. They won’t do an opening, they won’t do elections. It’s a regime which will remain in power until the Cuban people have the support to take it out.
Orlando: (25:55)
And what I want to end with, the last memory is, I was my grandfather’s only grandson, big family, only grandson. Before we left Cuba, my father went to see his father and my grandfather said without hesitation, “Get him out of here. Take him out of here. There’s no place for, to grow up. I want him to be a free man.” I’m very proud to be American. I’m very proud to be Cuban because I have a debt with him. I have a debt with my parents, with my grandparents, and with this country. So count on us. There should be a taskforce to educate Americans about socialism and communism, and we’re here to fight for Cuba, but also for the United States. Thank you so much and God bless.
President Donald Trump: (26:31)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Please. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 4: (26:40)
Sure?
President Donald Trump: (26:40)
I’m very sure.
Speaker 4: (26:42)
Listen, before I start, I need to first thank you for your sacrifice and the job you have done. And I also want to make sure that we understand that you are surrounded with very good people here in the State of Florida. And just to mention a few, we have the best Governor and Lieutenant governor in DeSantis and Jeanette Nunez. We have the best two senators in Mario, Mario is a congressman, but the two senators, Scott and Marco. Best congressmen for sure, guys sitting to your left, my dear friend. And I can not forget somebody who’s just been promoted very recently or I hope he gets vetted in front of the Senate, our dear Carlos [inaudible 00:00:27:36], very young man with a tremendous future. Thank you very much because you have selected those people and I assure you, they will be eternally loyal to you and they have your back. I assure you of that.
Speaker 4: (27:52)
Now, my story is very simple. We always talk about socialism. Socialism is nothing but communism during Halloween. There’s no such thing as socialism. America has always been the most socialist country in the world. We’re definitely the most generous. Look at the people in this table. Look at our backgrounds. Just thinking that in 1961, as a 13 year old, by myself, on my way to Spain. I wasn’t even coming here. I arrived in this great country and almost 60 years later, I’m sitting next to the President of the United States talking about the American dream. The only country in the world, no other country in the world that you can start a business from the trunk of your car and within a very few years with hard work, commitment, and all the core values that we learn from this very culture of ours, we can become very important to our future. We can become those people who make the next generation better than the one before. This is the only country. Why do you think you had to close the border?
Speaker 4: (29:37)
Because everybody in the world wants to come over here. Nobody’s ever forced to come over here. We come over here, in my case because my parents chose that I would not be indoctrinated by the communist country, by the totalitarian country, by the totalitarian regime. They don’t educate children. Absolutely not. And this is something that we need to understand. What is happening in our backyard today, I experienced as an 11 year old. I remember vividly all the promises that a guy named Castro gave and how 99% of the people swallowed the pill.
Speaker 4: (30:46)
It took many years later after I read somebody named Saul Alinsky that I realized that all those people were nothing but useful idiots. I remember Castro while in the mountains being interviewed and asked if he was a communist. He went crazy. “I dare you,” he says,” [foreign language 00:00:31:12]” the Roman Catholic. Educated by the Jesuits he was. “How dare you? We even have a priest in the mountains.” We used to have priests in the mountains. I remember I was in Marist Brothers, Christopher Columbus here for those who you know. And I remember the Brothers, the Marist Brothers used to send young kids to the mountains because it was the second coming of our Lord. He was going to save Cuba. I remember how he promised to the farmers, to the [foreign language 00:31:48] that you’re going to own the land. I remember all the promises that we hear today about free education and free healthcare.
Speaker 4: (32:02)
About free education and free healthcare and free land. My God, no freedom. But he never said that until after he was in power, got rid of all the police, got rid of all the military, been there for the last 60 years and counting. And he destroyed each and every one who helped him. The Catholic church, everybody. And why do I know that? Because I happened to come to this country with a very last nine cloister nuns from Convent Santa Clara, because he had taken over the convent. And I was on my way to Spain, I wasn’t even coming here, because I was going to join my brother, who my parents had already sent a few months before because he was in the age where the government will take him for indoctrination purposes.
Speaker 4: (33:07)
My dad who had experienced the same thing coming from Spain at the turn of the century, running away, not from socialism, communism. He knew better. I remember when he used to tell my mom, “Fefe, this SOB’s a communist.” My mother says, “Luca, how can you say that? He’s Catholic. Look, he’s wearing …” He had rosary beads all over his neck. It just so happened that when I was on my way to Spain to meet my brother, I was going to go to the marriage brothers in La Coruna, Spain. Same brothers here at Christopher Columbus, by the way. My brother died. And I was kept in this country. Greatest blessing I ever had. But imagine what happened to mom and dad.
Speaker 4: (34:11)
One day, you lose both kids. This is a family who had never been involved in politics. My father came at age 18 from Spain, running from communists. By himself, never went back. After a long, long life of sacrifice, when he was about to enjoy the fruit of his labors just like a president that is helping us today, because he could have been just having a good time, one of his many beautiful golf courses. But no. But yet he gave up enjoying the fruit of his labors to do this. So did my dad, that’s why I love you. Exactly the same. So when they’re about to do that from one day to the next, they end up in this country with the shirt that he was wearing on his back. And they did maximum, have been here already for years. But thank God for Pedro Pan.
Speaker 4: (35:14)
Talking about socialism, Catholic church, 14,000 kids who came like me in this country without parents. And we were provided an opportunity. This is what makes our country great. They didn’t give me free nothing, they gave me the opportunity. That is the most valuable thing in the world. Now, when I said they didn’t give me any free something, please understand that at 13 years old, I had to be provided with a home, had to be provided with food and an education. That is socialism, that’s Americanism, that’s the America that these people are trying to destroy today by using funny terms like socialism. They’re not, they’re communists. Don’t ever forget that. I know our President understands that because he knows, he’s been all over the world. And you’re surrounded with great people, very loyal people, and we have our back.
Speaker 4: (36:31)
I remember the first time I gave little speech about something like this, tell him about I came from Cuba, blah, blah, blah. I remember this was around October 2016. I thought you were a little crazy for the sacrifice you were about to take, but I predicted that we were going to elect you in November and I was going to see you in the White House in January. Thank you very much. Because of the situations right now, I cannot give you hug. Otherwise, thank you very much. And I going to leave you with one last thing. Never forget about my dad who only had a sixth grade education, but I think he was the greatest philosopher I ever met. He used to tell us how lucky he was because he was able to come from Spain to Cuba. And then he came from Cuba to United States. And he saw me graduate from college and that was the biggest prize he ever had. And he said, “Don’t lose these place because you’re never going to be as lucky as me. Because if you lose this place, you have no place to go.”
Speaker 4: (37:44)
So with that, please keep that in mind. And please, people, explain that to our young people who are demonstrating out there. Don’t be useful idiots. Please understand what’s happening in our country. See what happens to our parents and see what is happening to America today. Mr. President, thank you very much. And thank you for your hard work.
Donald Trump: (38:08)
Thank you very much. And he became one of the most successful men in Florida. So he did, that’s the only thing he didn’t say. But he did, and he’s a great gentlemen. Thank you very much, that was very nice. And now that you’ve cut everyone else down to about one minute, we appreciate that. Okay, do you mind? Okay, let’s go.
Speaker 4: (38:25)
I asked that, you know.
Donald Trump: (38:27)
Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Lourdes Ubieta: (38:31)
Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Lourdes Ubieta and I’ve been working in the media for over 25 years in Venezuela, Latin America, and the US. And I mean, I’m an immigrant. And the victim of socialism, not once, but twice. I was born in Venezuela to exiled Cuban parents who escaped the Castro communist tyranny and made a very successful life in other times, prosperous, but always generous Venezuela. For every single Venezuelan, life change when socialist corrupt [foreign language 00:00:39:05] Hugo Chavez came into power in 1999. After two decades of socialism in Venezuela, the country is destroyed. We are a poorer society with a failing purchasing power that limits the market for almost everything.
Lourdes Ubieta: (39:25)
79.3% of Venezuelan families can’t afford the basic food basket. Child mortality has dramatically increased. More than 500,000 households live in ranchos, what we call favelas. Just one out of four homes, Mr. President, has running water every day. Just one out of 10 homes has power every day. Out of 7.8 million childrens in the country, 40% report difficulties to attend school for problems with water supplies, blackout, no food at home, lack of transport, or lack of teachers. In conclusion, around half of the more vulnerable population can complete 12 years of school or graduate, which will help in some way to reduce the risk of remaining in poverty.
Lourdes Ubieta: (40:25)
We are 28.4 million people because about five million of us are abroad. Migration made us not only fewer, but older. We have more senior citizens more fragile in terms of health and productivity. Our society’s therefore for less able to produce wealth and more in need of different ways of assistance. This is the reality, Mr. President, of six out of every ten Venezuelan families. This number places Venezuela as the poorest country in Latin America and the Caribbean right now. Chavez will destroy the economy, our internal capacity to produce food and basic services, it ravaged the oil industry to the point that we can’t even produce our own gasoline. Above all this, Mr. President, transnational organized crime controls Venezuela. Drug cartels, Colombian guerillas, international mobs, and Iranian finance terrorists operates freely under the Chavez regime with a Cuban agenda. How, Mr. President, a hungry, broken, and sick country that has tried everything to get rid of this criminal regime, bathing our streets with the blood of the youngest, our political prisoners, exiles, [inaudible 00:00:42:07], and disappear all under the dominance of organized crime, how can they relieve themselves by themselves from this nightmare?
Lourdes Ubieta: (42:21)
You have been the only president who has stood firm against these criminals. Neither President Bush, much less President Barack Obama, I have to say, who privileged his relations with the Castro tyranny by sacrificing the Venezuelan democracy. They did nothing for Venezuelans to regain their freedom. Venezuela is kidnapped by the organized crime. Your actions, President, are the only hope for Venezuelans who wake up every day, let me tell you, every day they wake up looking at social networks to find out if there is a new measure by Donald Trump against that genocidal regime.
Lourdes Ubieta: (43:10)
Other than that, Mr. President, the greatest enemy of our Christian Jewish civilization is the Iranian regime. As you know, Mr. President, the Iranian regime is the [inaudible 00:43:22] the criminal regime in Venezuela. They are not longer in Asia. They are here, two and a half hour flight from Miami. The Iranian regime has it’s base in criminal operations in Venezuela, and that represents an imminent danger to the security of the USA and all of us US citizens and Americans. Today I ask you not to leave Venezuela. Each minute that passes is one of the greatest suffering for Venezuelans.
Lourdes Ubieta: (43:54)
Accelerate, Mr. President, the freedom of our country. At this moment, only a leadership like yours can finally achieve the freedom of Venezuela. On behalf of the Venezuelans, my family and my home, thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (44:09)
Thank you very much.
Lourdes Ubieta: (44:10)
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (44:12)
Beautifully stated. Thank you very much. We’re working very hard, you know that. Okay?
Lourdes Ubieta: (44:17)
I know, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (44:18)
Thank you very much.
Lourdes Ubieta: (44:20)
Thank you very much. And thank you very much, Mario, Congress, Mario Diaz-Balart. He has been the best friend that we could have also, the Venezuelan community. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (44:27)
Thank you.
Lourdes Ubieta: (44:27)
Thank you, President.
Donald Trump: (44:27)
Great job.
Mario Bramnick: (44:30)
President, it’s a great honor to be here to see you again. My name is Mario Bramnick. I’m a local pastor in South Florida. We also have the Latino Coalition for Israel following your great work of moving the embassy. And you’ve been the best friend of Israel that Israel ever has had. Also had the honor of serving on the National Hispanic Advisory Council for 2016 with Jenny Korn, and now. And the Advisory Board of Latinos for Trump. I cannot express our gratitude for the sacrifice that you and your family have made for our nation. And as has been shared here, all of the enemies of America are rising inside of America and globally to defeat your presidency in 2020. We can see because of what God is doing in your life and over your life, it is God’s hand, as a modern day Cyrus, that’s upon you. We are so grateful.
Mario Bramnick: (45:32)
I was born in Cuba and we fled communist Cuba to come to America for the American dream. In 2016, after eight years of Barack Obama, we were afraid what we fled from was coming to the shores of America. And now we’re being told that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are moderates compared to the new Democratic socialist party of Biden, Ocasio, Sanders. I mean, I think we should have a go fund trips to Venezuela and Cuba to see how good socialism would be for our nation. It’s unheard of. None of us here would have ever imagined that we would be seeing what we are seeing here now. I mean, it’s really the socialist anarchist anti-Christian party. The only good thing is that the American public has a clear description of what we’re up against. The Castro government murdered my wife’s father when she was five. We visited Cuba a year ago and there’s such poverty and misery where professionals make $80 a month. There’s shortages of all kinds of food, and they live in buildings that would be unsafe structures here in America.
Mario Bramnick: (46:55)
Thank you for cracking down on the Castro regime and reversing Obama’s detente. We as Cuban Americans are grateful and applaud that action. Under a Biden administration, he would undo that action and begin to support the communist regime. Thank you. Before COVID-19, we had the best record Hispanic unemployment of 3.9%, lowest poverty rate amongst Hispanics, and the Hispanic medium income was best than ever. We’re seeing an amazing economic turnaround. And you, Mr. President, are our best hope to make America great again, again. There’s no one else that can do what you did and we know you’re already doing it now. And I’ve been with you so often, we love you. [foreign language 00:15:50]. I know your heart for the Hispanics. I know your heart for the immigrants. I know your heart for the African-Americans. I was with Pastor Paula at the beginning, and I said, “At the end of your terms-”
Mario Bramnick: (48:02)
… at the beginning. And I said, at the end of your terms, terms, you will be known as a champion for Hispanic Americans and for African Americans. I believe all will know, because I know your heart and your labor for our community. Thank you. We had the honor of being with you yesterday at the Rose Garden for your new White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, empowering Hispanic Americans to prosper and giving us the opportunity for each to achieve the American dream.
Mario Bramnick: (48:31)
We as Cuban Americans love President Reagan. Many of us became Republicans during the Reagan era because of his strong stand and strong economics. But I believe that you are the best president for our community in the history of our nation. We do see God’s hand upon you. We applaud the US-Mexican Trade Agreement, what you’re doing with Mexico, what you’re doing with Central America.
Mario Bramnick: (48:56)
I believe that Cyrus Mantle over your life, also, in a sense, the leadership in our organization, we deal with heads of state in Latin America on their move of their embassy, they’re all looking to your leadership, to the vice president, to this administration. And really there’s so much in the balance.
Mario Bramnick: (49:14)
I’ll end with this. We were at a White House dinner, and I said, “Mr. President, we pray for you. There’s a bullseye on your chest. There’s a terrible attack against you, your family, and what you have to endure.” We’re praying for you, for the First Lady, and for your family. But it’s not so much an attack against you. It’s an attack against the soul of our nation. You are what is standing between capitalism and communism. You are what is standing between prosperity and poverty. Between liberty and tyranny for our nation.
Mario Bramnick: (49:51)
I would dread to think what would happen if you’re not our president, but I know with all that you’re doing and because of God’s hand upon you, that we will prevail in 2020. If we lose 2020, we lose our nation. Our freedom of speech, our freedom of religion, as was mentioned, and our freedom of press. And yet there’s a complicit press, not realizing what they’re supporting. They’re going to lose their own rights. It’s 1776 all over again, and we are here with you, praying for you, mobilizing to make sure that we don’t lose our nation.
Mario Bramnick: (50:24)
In closing, thank you so much for your leadership, for your sacrifice, for your moral clarity, your bold determination, and your unwavering commitment to the Hispanic Americans, to all Americans, and to our democratic ideals. Thank you so much.
Donald Trump: (50:40)
Thank you very much [inaudible 00:02:41]. Very nice. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Please.
Lorenzo DeStefano: (50:46)
Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Lorenzo DeStefano. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and I have a bachelor degree in administrative science. In Venezuela, I started my family and worked professionally in the insurance business. In the year 2000, I had an opportunity for my business to grow and political change in Venezuela was emerging, so I decided to move my family to the United States under L1 L2 visa.
Lorenzo DeStefano: (51:17)
The initial idea was to stay four to five years here in Miami, then return to my country. But due to the political disaster in Venezuela, we decided to choose an American residency and stay in Miami.
Lorenzo DeStefano: (51:31)
I was lucky to invest in the gastronomic field, which was a hobby for me, but it became a reality. I was one of the owner of [inaudible 00:03:43]. As the business was growing and due to fire in [inaudible 00:51:50] was created and in less than a year, the partnership dissolves making me the sole owner of [inaudible 00:03:57].
Lorenzo DeStefano: (51:57)
It was there that my true feelings towards Venezuela emerged. I start to participate and get more involved with the problems that my Venezuelan brother and sister live day in and day out. I always try to help and give the best I could give from Miami. I saw how sad my Venezuelan brother and sister were of leaving Venezuela, even though fleeing insecurity and hunger. Those who had the possibility of arriving in Miami didn’t know where to go, how to invest or work, in short many of them looked for help in my business, and there were always people who could help them, making [inaudible 00:52:48] to the Venezuelan [inaudible 00:52:51].
Lorenzo DeStefano: (52:49)
Mr. President, Venezuela was a paradise, it had everything. Unfortunately, the mistake was made to choosing a president who would guide the country to Castro, communist terrorists, and drug trafficking. With this topic I could exceed my time. Therefore, I want to conclude with the following.
Lorenzo DeStefano: (53:15)
Mr. President, Venezuela is already having socialists and communist problems. On behalf of all my Venezuelan people American Republican, I ask you not to allow this to happen to the United States of America, and to please continue with more sanction and more economic pressure on Venezuela, since we all know that the humanitarian intervention is not easy to exercise, but neither impossible. God bless you. God bless America. And thank you Mr. President, and Trump for four years more.
Donald Trump: (53:50)
Thank you very much. Beautiful. Thank you very much.
Speaker 5: (53:58)
Thank you so much, Mr. President. I’m truly honored to be here as a voice for freedom of [inaudible 00:54:06] people and among so dear friends. Thank you Mr. President, for meeting with us today, for your friendship and for standing with us, the Cuban people, who wants to be free to decide our own destiny.
Speaker 5: (54:25)
Thank you, Mr. President, also for your historic actions to support democracy in Cuba and to pressure the cruel communist dictatorship. Our Cuban people suffer constant oppression from the socialist state. For more than six decades, communist Castro regime has imposed the culture of disclusion and the discrimination against any Cuban with a divergent expression. They abolished our civil liberties, our freedom of faith, and of speech. They tried to delete our history, our faith, and our culture.
Speaker 5: (55:08)
The Castro regime tied the hands of the Cuban people to make us poor and dependent because communism mutilates the human soul in order to control the society. Those who rise their voice in favor of freedom, in favor of justice, those are risking prison and even death.
Speaker 5: (55:32)
This July 22nd, we’ll mark eight years since my father, Oswald [Abaya 00:07:37], was assassinated by the communist regime. My father founded and led the Christian Movement for Liberation. He was a leader of the political opposition, but he was also a moral leader to thousands and thousands of people who demand their right to have a voice and participate to change the system. He was the most generous man I ever met, and he was killed by the communist regime. They were trying to kill his legacy, because they were in fear of the faithful, in fear of the conviction of a silent majority awakening and demanding freedom.
Speaker 5: (56:33)
Although the communist regime was able to kill my father, they were not able to kill his legacy. They were not able to distinguish the resolve of our people to secure our liberation. On the contrary, our resolve is a stronger than ever. We carry on his work. Our movement grows faster every day. We will not relent until we are free. We’re going to finish what he, and many others, started.
Speaker 5: (57:10)
I’m a freedom fighter, but they are many of us among Cuba, and in this table also. I know that you, Mr. President, you are also a fighter for the freedom of the United State and the freedom of the world.
Speaker 5: (57:28)
Mr. President, I invite you to join me in commemorating July 22nd to honor the victims of communism in all the Americas. To honor all of those who has fought and died, defending democracy in Venezuela, in Nicaragua, in Cuba, and in other parts of our continent also. It is important, it’s vital, to rise our voices, to call for liberation of the political prisoners and to stop the impunity of the Castro regime. The same impunity that Castro felt when he killed my father, thinking that the world was not going to react.
Speaker 5: (58:15)
Mr. President, Cuba is in crisis. Families are living through a deep humanitarian crisis and political repression. A crises caused by the existence of a corrupt and criminal regime. A regime that has nothing to offer to their own people, but repression and violence. That’s what they are implementing right now against the citizenry. People are being detained, threatened, [inaudible 00:58:44] cell phones, even physically assault, beaten up in the streets, taken to prison, simply for taking a photo in the streets or posting in social media. That’s the lever of fear and the weakness of the Castro regime right now.
Speaker 5: (59:03)
This is why your solidarity and humanitarian help and the economic opportunities that Cuba needs should be directed only towards the Cuban people, preventing intervention from the regime. Because the repressors should be called out. We can, and do, Mr. President to continue shutting down all of the dictatorships sources of funding, which it uses to sustain the Cuban military, its apparatus of oppression, and its narco terrorists activities.
Speaker 5: (59:43)
Mr. President, this hemisphere has paid a high price for tolerating six decades of Castro communism in Cuba. A regime that has cost the end of the democracy in Venezuela and in Nicaragua, and the largest refugee crisis of our lives. It is time to end it.
Speaker 5: (01:00:07)
The regime that infiltrates society to spread chaos, hate, and division, [inaudible 01:00:15] they are democratic governments throughout the hemisphere, and also here in the United States. Throughout the use of propaganda, the communist ideology has contaminated the minds and soul of young people in Latin America and in the United States. It is time to tell them the truth.
Speaker 5: (01:00:38)
President Trump, this dictatorship threaten peace and security of the continent. As you know, they are involved in criminal and terrorist related activities, drug trafficking, trafficking persons through the communist medical brigades, corruption, providing sanctuary and support to terrorist. Mr. President, I encourage you to indict Raul Castro, Diaz-Canel, and all the top officials of the regime. And very importantly, I encourage you to designate the Cuba military intelligence services and the Cuban Communist Party as foreign terrorist organizations, because they are relation with the crime and the narcoterrorism threatening the region. Our movement, Cuba Decides, is a national and global initiative to force the Cuban regime to submit to the will of the people and leave. It is imperative that all the nations in the free world support the Cuban people’s fight for change, because the victory of the democracy in Cuba is essential to open the path to peace, prosperity, and stability in the whole hemisphere.
Speaker 5: (01:02:04)
Mr. President, my father, in a letter to the Congress, to the United States, he said that we Cubans, we wants to be free and we wants to be friends with the American people. Please accept this cuff links with the coat of arms of the Republic of Cuba as a symbol of the friendship between our two people, and also as a symbol of our appreciation for your actions and your solidarity.
Speaker 5: (01:02:40)
Thank you so much, Mr. President [crosstalk 01:02:42]. I’m looking forward to working together with you very soon for the [inaudible 01:02:46] a free Cuba. Thank you so much.
Donald Trump: (01:02:48)
Thank you very much. Well, I want to everybody, I will not forget what I heard today. It’s very moving. It’s a very tough situation. We’ve made a lot of progress, as you probably have seen and you know. I have a feeling you won’t be disappointed.
Donald Trump: (01:03:06)
And by the way, 2020 is very important. Very important. Good luck to everybody. Thank you. Really a good job. Beautiful job. I won’t forget. You have a great representative right here. Mario will be speaking. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Jul 10, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. And thank you to our great Admiral Faller. Thank you also to all of the exceptional leaders and talents that we have in this room. US Southern Command is just an outstanding group of people. Thank you very much, very much, Admiral. We’re here today to discuss our vital effort to keep deadly drugs out of our country and away from our children. And wow, are we making progress in a short period of time, thanks to you. It’s amazing. I’ve come to personally thank you. I wanted to make this trip personally. We were going to do a phoner and I said, “A phoner’s not quite the same thing, is it?” So I came to personally thank you for your valiant fight to defend our borders and take our vile traffickers, these vile traffickers, out of business, knock them out of business. The smugglers, the criminal cartels, we want to knock them out.
Donald Trump: (01:00)
You’re on the front lines every day saving countless American lives and delivering the righteous thunder of American justice. No adversary can match the awesome power of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marines. And I must tell you, very soon, we’re going to have a thing called Space Force. You know about that, right? Space Force, that’s a big deal. One of the many things we’ve done in this administration that’s going to be one of the most important, I predict.
Donald Trump: (01:28)
Let us also show our deep appreciation for your law enforcement partners at the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. We’ll always stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement. We will never, ever defund our police. Okay? That I can tell you, we’re not defending police. What’s going on here, Admiral, when you hear defund the police, you’re probably saying, “That’s a foreign language, right?” So just a terrible thing, but it’s I assume this is going to be a fad. We’ll call it a fad. But it’s not something that will work very well, that I can tell you. We’re pleased to be joined by Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper. Thank you very much, Mark. Thank you. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf. I think we’re keeping him pretty busy, right? He’s been a busy man. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Karl Schultz. Admiral, thank you very much. And a great warrior, he’s a warrior, he’s a strong guy, a great guy, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (02:43)
On the first of this year, I announced that the United States Armed Forces would begin a surge of military assets in the western hemisphere unlike anything seen in recent history. And that is a fact. One of the reasons is we now have better equipment than we’ve ever had. We have new beautiful equipment that comes along with $2.5 trillion in spending, all made in the USA. Over the last three months, American service members joined by partner nations have patrolled regional waters from the Caribbean Sea to the East Pacific. The United States deployed a vast arsenal of Coast Guard Cutters, Naval combat ships, specially armed Coast Guard helicopters, and they are real weapons, they are powerful weapons. High-tech maritime patrol aircraft, as well as roughly 1,300 additional personnel. These forces represent a 65% increase in ships and a 75% increase in surveillance aircraft from last year alone.
Donald Trump: (03:44)
We’re taking the fight directly to the sinister criminal cartels and we’re showing them no mercy. We are doing numbers like nobody thought possible. Even the Admiral, he would say that he would have never thought this was going to happen to the extent that it’s happened. Our message is clear, you will not threaten our citizens, you will not poison our children, and you will not infiltrate our borders. We will find you, we will stop you, and we will put everybody that we find behind bars if you’re lucky. The results of this historic international campaign have been absolutely phenomenal. This joint operation has resulted in the interdiction of more than 120 metric tons. Does anyone know how much that is? Of illicit narcotics. That is a massive, billions and billions. And they arrested more than 1000 drug traffickers. These actions have denied the cartel of billions of various cartels of billions and billions of dollars in cash and prevented the loss of untold American lives that we’ve seen the results in the United States.
Donald Trump: (04:54)
In a single four day period in May, our courageous Coast Guard men and women stopped three narco-submarines packed with poisonous drugs, keeping thousands of pounds of lethal narcotics off of our streets and off of our city areas. We got rid of it. We got it. We have it. And I don’t know what you do with it. What do you do with it, by the way? You get all that stuff, you dump it? What do you do with it, Admiral?
Speaker 2: (05:18)
Turn it over to-
Donald Trump: (05:19)
I want to hear. What do you do with that?
Speaker 2: (05:22)
So we keep some for prosecution, then it’s destroyed by our partner.
Donald Trump: (05:25)
You blow it up or just dump it someplace?
Speaker 2: (05:28)
They burn it, sir.
Donald Trump: (05:29)
They burn it, all right. That sounds like a good way of doing it. On behalf of millions of American moms and dads, I want to express our country’s pride and gratitude for your lifesaving actions. My administration is committed to ensuring you have the tools, the resources, equipment, and support you need and the support that you deserve, and you’ve always deserved it. And you used to run short. You don’t run short anymore. You have the best equipment in the world. After years of painful budget cuts, I ended last year’s disastrous defense sequester and secured almost the 2.5 billion that I mentioned to rebuild our entire United States military. We’re giving you the finest airplanes and ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, and weapons of every single kind, even new uniforms in some cases, for the Army, as an example. And again, all made in the USA. I love that sound, made in the USA.
Donald Trump: (06:21)
We’ve approved the two new state of the art National Security Cutters, and two Polar Security Cutters for the United States Coast Guard, and so much other equipment, including, we have under construction right now, the largest icebreaker in the world. And we’re going to be trying to get, if we can, an extra 10 icebreakers, we only have one. Russia has 40, we have one. So we will have two, but we think we’ll have 10 because we’re trying to do a deal with a certain place that has a lot of icebreakers. And we’re seeing if we can make a really good deal where you can have them very fast, you know about that, we’re working on it. And I think we can surprise you at a very good price, which will be nice, much cheaper than the one we’re building. And that’s also nice. You can do about five of them.
Donald Trump: (07:09)
Our enemies are unnoticed because the United States military is much more powerful, much more lethal, and much more prepared than ever before. We’re in a position that we’ve never been in equipment-wise and we have the greatest people on earth. We’re also supporting the courageous men and women of CBP, ICE, Border Patrol, and DEA, and FBI, and all of the heroes of law enforcement, great people. As long as I am President, I will never allow your sacred mission to be undermined or attacked in any way. I will not have open borders, we will not abolish the police, and we will not slash the budgets for our military, and we will not allow our country to be swamped with deadly drugs.
Donald Trump: (07:53)
We have stopped numbers that we’ve never stopped before or even close. And we have done it in a way that our enemy understands. And they’re getting a little bit concerned because they’ve never had losses like this, they’ve never had submarines taken from them. They actually build submarines because, smaller versions of what we have, to put it mildly, much smaller, but they’re submarines, nevertheless, very expensive things. And they’ve never seen anything like what’s happened to them in the last year and a half. We will defend our country, we will defend our borders, our children, our heroes, and our great American flag, we’ll always defend our American flag, we’re very proud of our flag. We will protect, preserve, and promote the American way of life and we will always stand strong for God, country, family, and freedom.
Donald Trump: (08:44)
I just want to thank everybody for being here. This is a very special moment. I think especially so because you’ve done so much over the last short period of time to bring life and safety to the United States of America and other parts of the world, by the way, but to the United States. And I want to thank you. God bless you all. Thank you very much. Admiral, thank you very much. Thank you."
"Jul 10, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:09)
Thank you very much. I guess I might begin. It’s an honor to be with you and really brave men and women, the job you do is incredible. And the progress that you’ve made in the last short period of time has been unbelievable.
President Donald Trump: (00:31)
On April first of this year, I announced the launch of a powerful US military law enforcement operation to combat the flow of illegal drugs across the Western hemisphere. Today, I’m pleased to be with Admiral Craig Faller, and his team, done an incredible job at the U S Southern command headquarters to provide an update on this incredible successful effort. We’re joined by secretary of defense, Mark Esper, thank you, Mark. Acting secretary of Homeland security, Chad Wolf, Chad, thank you, thank you. Commandant of US coast guard, Admiral Karl Schultz, Admiral. Associate deputy attorney general, Amanda Liskamm. Thank you, thank you, Amanda. Congressman Mario Diaz Bullock, who is a friend of mine for a long time. Thank you very much for a great job you’re doing down here. And many, many others, leaders and military geniuses and people that do a fantastic job.
President Donald Trump: (01:36)
In just 12 weeks, SOUTHCOMs surge operation conducted with key regional partners has resulted in more than 1000 arrests and the interdiction of 120 metric tons. I can only tell you that’s a lot of narcotics worth billions and billions of dollars. We’re determined to keep dangerous drugs out of the country and away from our children. We’re securing our seas. We’re securing our borders. This is a new operation, not been done before, and this operation has been incredibly successful. As you know, in the United States, at least before the COVID came to us, the flu, the virus, the China virus, whatever you’d like to call it, it’s got many different names, but before it hit, we were doing really well. We’re still doing very well, but now we’re getting back on track.
President Donald Trump: (02:27)
Last year, 70,000 precious American lives were taken because of the poison the cartels bring into our country. Under my administration, drug overdose deaths fell for the first time in nearly 30 years, and they fell fairly substantially. Unfortunately, the shutdowns caused by the China virus have led to a recent rise in overdose deaths, still below the level that they were at, but nevertheless went up a little bit. This is one of the reasons that we’re working to safely and responsibly reopen our country, reopen our schools, get our country going again a hundred percent. Were setting records on jobs, were setting records on many different things. We’re going to have a great third quarter, third quarter is going to be tremendous numbers, fourth quarter, likewise. And next year economically, will be one of the best years we’ve ever had, but you’ll see the numbers starting to come out really, really high in the third quarter. And you’ve already seen the record breaking, job numbers, NASDAQ just hit recently about 12 record highs, 12 days record highs, and the other markets are right behind it. There’ll be hitting records hopefully very shortly also. That means people have a lot of confidence in what we’re doing.
President Donald Trump: (03:40)
With the help of the heroes here at SOUTHCOM, coast guard, CBP, DEA and law enforcement will work relentlessly to seize illegal drugs, arrest traffickers, the traffickers are truly vile. They’re terrible, terrible people, what they do mostly to women and children, but women, and dismantle criminal cartels who are responsible for the deaths of thousands and thousands of Americans.
President Donald Trump: (04:06)
I’d like now to introduce secretary Asper, to say a few words. Mark, please. Thank you.
Secretary Asper: (04:13)
Yes. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you very much, sir. And good afternoon, everyone. It’s a pleasure to be here today to discuss the successes of our enhanced counteract narcotics operations in the Eastern Pacific ocean and the Caribbean sea.
Secretary Asper: (04:26)
The department of defense began this initiative alongside our inter-agency partners at the president’s direction on April 1st as part of our whole of government effort to combat the flow of illicit drugs into our country and to protect the American people.
Secretary Asper: (04:42)
Transnational criminal organizations have destroyed far too many American lives by smuggling, heroin cocaine, fentanyl, and methamphetamines in our country, leading to drug overdoses and addiction in our communities. Moreover, the profits derived from these activities support a range of bad actors, from cartels in Mexico to the illegitimate Maduro regime, which continues to oppress the Venezuelan people.
Secretary Asper: (05:08)
Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, our enhanced counter-narcotics operations have shown great success in countering those threats by disrupting the flow of illicit drugs, denying our adversaries financial resources and strengthening the capacity of partner countries in the region.
Secretary Asper: (05:25)
Since the end of March, we have employed in the US Southern command area of responsibility, 75% more surveillance aircraft and 65% more ships than normal for drug interdiction. These additional assets include four Navy destroyers, five coast guard cutters, and eight aircraft.
Secretary Asper: (05:41)
Currently nearly a dozen Navy and coast guard ships and over 15 aircraft from across the inner agency are supporting our efforts in addition to security forces deployed to the region. Further, we have successfully engaged and encouraged 22 partner nations to join us in this fight, and step up their involvement in drug introductions.
Secretary Asper: (06:02)
As a result of these enhanced operations, SOUTHCOM and our inter-agency and international partners have disrupted more than 122 metric tons of cocaine, as well as over 18,000 pounds of marijuana. We denied nearly $2 billion in drug profits, increased our targeting of known smuggling maritime events by 60% and neutralized dozens of members of transnational criminal organizations.
Secretary Asper: (06:27)
These efforts have been critical to saving countless American lives and making our communities healthier, safer, and stronger. I want to thank the president, president Trump for his leadership and bringing us together and support this critical mission. Thank you, sir. And I’m grateful for the hard work of our partners, including the US coast guard, the department of Homeland security, the drug enforcement administration, the department of justice, members of the intelligence community and support from Congress as well for all of their efforts. Together, we will maintain our enhanced presence in the region, keep the pressure on transnational criminal groups and protect America and our communities from the scourge of illicit drugs. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (07:13)
Thank you Admiral.
Admiral: (07:14)
Thank you, sir.
Admiral: (07:16)
Mr. President, secretary Esper, secretary Wolf, Shipmate, Charles Schultz, hometown Congressman here, Mario Diaz, thank you all for your support on this important mission. This mission is vital to our Homeland defense. It truly is. And I’m proud to say the efforts are making a difference, Mr. President, and they’re saving lives. And a team here that’s assembled deserves the credit, but the resources that you’ve ordered have made that happen.
Admiral: (07:43)
Other nations have stepped up, Mr. President. Columbia for one have stepped up, despite COVID. US leadership has been a key piece.
Admiral: (07:53)
Mr.President, if I would, I just wanted to show a map, I have a little version of front of you, just orient on the hemisphere here. If we could put the map up. So the South comes a responsibility, this Western hemisphere really it’s our neighborhood it’s so close to home. So what impacts the neighbors really has a high impact on us at home Mr. President. And that’s why this is so important.
Admiral: (08:16)
There’s so much opportunity here. It’s our number two trading partner outside of Asia. And so trade, economics and democracy importantly. And our partner nations are willing, they want to work with us and we work with partners from Guatemala on South and out into the Caribbean.
Admiral: (08:34)
But that’s under assault, this vicious circle of threats that you see led by the transnational criminal organizations about a $90 billion a year enterprise, and it heeds off corruption, and now the added instability of COVID. But as I said, that partners have stepped up despite the COVID, which is a tribute to their security teams.
Admiral: (08:55)
There’s also another aspect in this neighborhood of ours, and it’s what we call a national defense strategy, great power competition.
Admiral: (09:02)
So China has certainly looked at this neighborhood as an opportunity for them. And when you think about the proximity of some of their investments, Jamaica and El Salvador, it’s just as close to Washington as is to Miami, is if you look at comparative distances.
Admiral: (09:18)
Slide, please. But what our citizens want, I know certainly my dad in Western PA, who’s watching once is they want to know if we’re making a difference. And the numbers, as we’ve stated, really have, at 15% more disruptions, that’s detainees, that’s drugs off the street. That’s at 122 metric tons, Mr. President. And 60% more targeting is a big deal for us because that means we can put more assets on more targets. And the enemy has seen. That we’ve gotten information from our intelligence agencies that says the enemies watch that, and they’re waiting and they’re stockpiling, and they’re trying to change their tactics.
Admiral: (09:54)
Those additional Navy ships, the AWACS from the air force, Oklahoma guard MC twelves, DEA agents, a whole team effort, really, as we make a difference…
Admiral: (10:03)
… DEA agents, a whole team effort really as we make a difference here. But that 70% partner participation is key, Mr. President. And I think of it this way, on the field to compete when you go to golf or baseball, you want the best players with you. And we certainly have those winners with us here today. Just wanted to introduce you to two, Mr. President. Brigadier General Juan Carlos Correa, if you’d stand up, General. [inaudible 00:00:26].
Admiral: (10:26)
President Duque has sent us his best and paying for it. So he comes here fully paid by Colombia and he works for me. And it’s a recognition that Colombia’s with us in the Korean War and they’re with us today and making a difference. [inaudible 00:10:44] And our Brazilian, President Bolsonaro, very new addition to our headquarters, Major General David. One of the sharpest and Brazilian armed forces NRJ5 organization. Again, Brazilian’s paying for him to come here and work for me to make a difference in security. Brazil has been with us since World War II and our relationship is growing even stronger, Mr. President. [inaudible 00:01:09].
Admiral: (11:09)
Last two points, Mr. President, the tactical into this fight, and you remember being in Key West at joint interagency task force, [inaudible 00:11:17] you rang that bell. And the war fighters responsible for that fight, Rear Admiral Doug Fears at the end Commands [inaudible 00:11:24] South and Master Chief Henry [inaudible 00:11:26] is the senior enlisted there. They’re the ones that are really day in and day out the tactical edge of this fight, sir. And I’ll tell you, Mr. President, they’re ringing the enemies bell every day, sir.
President Donald Trump: (11:37)
They seem to be. It’s a fantastic job.
Admiral: (11:39)
Thank you, sir.
President Donald Trump: (11:39)
Thank you very much. Mr. Congressmen, you like to say something, thank you.
Secretary Asper: (11:45)
Mr. President, nothing prepared, but I can tell you in my time of Congress, which is now almost 18 years, this region has frankly been looked over. Just barely any attention paid to it. And sometimes when the attention was paid, bad things were done. I will tell you that your administration has emphasized freedom. I want to thank you by the way, on a personal note, a little bit of a more parochial note for your emphasis on helping the people of Venezuela regain their freedom. Helping the people of Nicaragua regain their freedom. And your solidarity to the people of Cuba, which has been frankly, like we’ve never seen. But your leadership here in fighting narcotics coming to the United States is literally saving American lives.
Secretary Asper: (12:43)
So again, just as one who represents Southern Command grateful for your emphasis of this command and what they do, but for your leadership and actually saving American lives, those who are victimized every year by this scourge of illicit narcotics. So thank you for being here, but more importantly, thank you for your leadership and your emphasis on those key issues.
President Donald Trump: (13:03)
Well, I want to thank you for your leadership. You have done a fantastic job. You represent the area so well, I know this area quite well, as you can imagine, but I know it very well. Little Venezuela we call it and incredible people, I know the people. And we’re going to be fighting for Venezuela. We’re going to be fighting for our friends from Cuba. They know that we’ve been doing that and so many other places. But Cuba, Venezuela, we have it very well under control and you know what we’re doing and we’re in touch all the time. So I want to thank you for your tremendous work. And maybe I could ask Amanda to say a few words, please.
Amanda: (13:40)
Thank you. I’m honored to be here today with our interagency partner to recognize the incredible work being done, to disrupt the flow of drugs to the United States. Drug trafficking organizations are devastating this country with the drugs that they are pumping in. We continue to see Mexican cartels traffic, cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl into the United States. This fentanyl is fueling the ongoing domestic opioid crisis, and we are seeing an increasing surge in low cost, high purity and high potency methamphetamine. Further, Colombian cartels continue to control the production and supply of cocaine and rely on a partnership with Mexican cartels to export multi-ton quantities of cocaine from Colombia to US markets. As these drugs are more readily available and more deadly, we are seeing record level overdose death rates. Every year more Americans die from overdoses in the United States than died in the entirety of the Vietnam war.
Amanda: (14:37)
And now for the first time in our country’s history, our odds of dying from an opioid overdose are greater than from a motor vehicle crash. The Department of Justice is committed to defeating these cartels who are directly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year by flooding this country with addictive poison. The Department charged a record number of defendants with drug trafficking offenses last year in an effort to hold these traffickers accountable. Indeed, several leaders of Mexican cartels received significant sentences, such as life imprisonment over the past several years. And despite the influx of drugs into the United States, DEA has domestic seizures are at record levels.
Amanda: (15:17)
However, this work alone is not enough. It is clear that we can obtain the most immediate result by increasing our ability to make drug interdictions at sea before they reach the United States. This surge has been a tremendous success with over 120 metric tons of cocaine seized. The drugs seized represent almost $2 billion in profits denied to these cartels and an untold number of American lives saved. Numerous traffickers responsible for these loads of drugs will be held accountable in United States federal district courts. Since the start of the search, the Department of Justice has charged more than 60 defendants for their role and trafficking these drugs into the United States. This is truly a whole of government effort. And when we are proud to be a part of. Working together, we can and will interdict these deadly drugs before they reach our country and destroy the cartels who are responsible. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (16:07)
Thank you, Amanda. Great job you’re doing, appreciate it. Thank you. Admiral, please.
Edward: (16:12)
Mr. President, it’s an honor to be here with you and it’s honored to be back at SOUTHCOM. I had the privilege of serving. This is a great team, highly professional, doing tremendous things in the region, sir. To the DHS team, just starting, your Coast Guard has been in this game with our DHS partners, CVP, Air Marine, the Homeland Security Investigations office. We’ve been involved about 1.8 million pounds of cocaine eradicated here in the last four years. This surge here with the support of the SecDef and your support and the SOUTHCOM team, sir, has been successful. We integrate in a joint environment remarkably well. We’ve heard the numbers, so I won’t repeat them. But these are transnational criminals, sir. And these are very sophisticated groups. Craig mentioned, it’s a $90 billion annual industry that we’re disrupting here.
Edward: (16:52)
So I’m very excited about being here. The Coast Guard has committed to a doubling down our efforts here through the end of the calendar year. We take some risk other places, but this is righteous work. The numbers on American streets, it’s something north of 70,000 when you roll in the overdoses, you roll in drug related violence. You look at the corruption in the region, sir, this is important work for the nation. So thank you for your support and honored to be here.
President Donald Trump: (17:12)
Thank you very much, Edward. Appreciate it. Now, Chad Wolfe, maybe you could also mention what’s going on in Portland because we sent you there recently. It was out of control. The locals couldn’t handle it and you people are handling it very nicely. So nicely that the press doesn’t want to write about it. But why don’t you tell them what you’re doing in Portland and also go into this please.
Chad Wolf: (17:32)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. I think what we see in Portland is really a smaller example of what we see around the country regarding some of the civil unrest and the attacks on law enforcement. And what you find in Portland is about five and a half weeks of continued violence against the federal courthouse there tHAT the Department of Homeland Security protects. We’ve had to send in additional individuals. Were making arrests but there has been violence. There’s been assaults on federal law enforcement officers and it really just shouldn’t occur. We should have more support of the local police there, but again, the Department of Homeland Security, along with the DOJ, FBI and others are surging resources and we’re starting to make a difference there.
President Donald Trump: (18:11)
Yeah, how many of you arrested?
Chad Wolf: (18:12)
I believe it’s been close to a dozen thus far and DOJ has charged almost as many as well.
President Donald Trump: (18:18)
And I know you have it in very good control, but it’s a pretty wild group, but you have it in very good control. So we appreciate it. Local law enforcement has been told not to do too much and it’s not the way it’s supposed to be, but that’s okay. Good job. You’ve really done a great job.
Chad Wolf: (18:34)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (18:35)
Go ahead, please.
Chad Wolf: (18:36)
Well, for decades, let me just build on what the Commandant said. For decades, counter-drug operations have really been at the core of both the Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security’s mission. Year after year, the Coast Guard has stood watch both in the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific. And so with this operation, Mr. President, you have recognized the threat that illicit narcotics play harming America. And while previous administrations have admired the problem, you are taking concrete actions with this operation. This effort is bringing the power of the United States military along with the Department to bear on this problem. And we’re having successes that we’ve talked about. What we’ve seen is the partnership, again, DHS, not only the Coast Guard, CBP, air assets are flying constantly in the region as well. And we have ICE Homeland Security investigations helping DOJ, as we heard, prosecute. We are one team accomplished on a shared objective and that’s keeping the American people safe at the end of the day.
Chad Wolf: (19:31)
Mr. President, I would say the men and women of the Coast Guard are unrivaled when it comes to sea-based drug interdiction. While it takes a whole of government approach, from collecting intelligence to identifying targets, is the brave men and women of the Coast Guard continue to be at the tip of the spear. And whether it’s from a Coast Guard cutter or a Navy ship, coast guardsmen every day are directly engaging narco traffickers and taking them down. So I wanted to make sure that you were absolutely clear on that front and we certainly value the partnership that we’re getting from DOD, SOUTHCOM and others. And what we heard also is really at your-
Chad Wolf: (20:03)
… The SOUTHCOM and others. And what we heard also is really at your direction. We’re not only seeing targets at drug cartels. We’re also seeing rogue nation states and politicians that support them. We talked about Departments of Justices recent indictment of Nicolas Maduro, and 14 of his cronies that proved to the world that everyone involved in drug smuggling will be held accountable. I really think that, that sends an example to all. Whether again, you’re a drug cartel, you’re a DTO, or you’re a rogue nation state we’re coming after you. So again, thank you for your support.
President Donald Trump: (20:31)
Thank you very much.
Chad Wolf: (20:32)
And I think actions speak louder than words in this case.
President Donald Trump: (20:34)
Thank you, Chad. And the wall is coming along very well. Chad is responsible for supervising that along with the Army Corps of engineers who have been fantastic. And Mark Esper, that’s been really one of your pet projects and it’s been going along. We’re up to 250 miles and that’s real wall. That’s a wall that you don’t get through. It’s a tough stuff and built to the highest standard, built to everything that Border Patrol wanted. They all sat down and they designed their perfect wall. And then we said, “Let’s build it that way.” And we’re up to 250 miles by the end of the year, we’ll be up to 450 or so, and we’ll have it finished very shortly thereafter. And it’s made a tremendous difference because your numbers on the Southern border are very, very small coming through. And especially with COVID that turned out to be very lucky for us that we had the wall, or we would have been inundated because they do have some big problems.
President Donald Trump: (21:29)
I was with a great gentleman, the president of Mexico, two days ago, we had a long talk about the Southern border and Mexico. And they’ve had some difficulty, but he’s doing a fantastic job as president, but the wall is very exciting and we’ll have that open relatively very, very shortly. And that was despite all odds, I would say. Mark, wouldn’t you say? That was despite all odds. We had a certain party that was against it. They’re not against it anymore. In the end they just raised their hand, they said, “We don’t want to take this on because politically it turned out to be as good as we always knew.” Two things never change, walls and wheels. Wheel will never change. They were talking about technology. Technology is no good without the wall.
President Donald Trump: (22:13)
But it’s something that I’ve heard for a long time. Two things you will never change in a 1,000 years from now a wheel and a wall, they work. And this wall has really been unbelievable the way it’s worked. So great job and let’s get it finished and tremendous numbers on the Southern border. Very few people coming in. Appreciate it. And we’ve made a lot of legal changes too. Makes it a lot easier for you. Robert, please.
Robert: (22:37)
Mr. President, thank you. I want to take folks back to April 1st as the COVID crisis was breaking and all attention was focused on it. The president had the foresight to launch an enhanced operation to disrupt the flow of dangerous drugs to the United States from narco terrorist. Our adversaries believed that the United States would be distracted, but Mr. President, you weren’t distracted. And I think you remember sent Secretary Wolf and Admiral Schultz, Secretary Esper, attorney general of army out to make the announcement on this operation.
Robert: (23:07)
The traffickers use their funds for nefarious purposes among them to finance the regime of Nicolas Maduro. The illegitimate regime in Venezuela, and for years, Venezuela has flooded the United States with cocaine. It poisons our communities and it fuels a dangerous epidemic of addiction that threatens the safety and security of all Americans. The situation in Venezuela has gotten so bad that earlier this week, Admiral Fowler called the Venezuela a paradise for drug traffickers who enjoy the support and cooperation of the Maduro regime and his allies. At a crackdown on the traffickers President, Trump deployed additional ships, aircraft security forces that you’ve heard about.
Robert: (23:49)
But the other thing that he did, which is less focused on is he rallied our 22 nation coalition partnership to help in this effort to interdict drugs. So that fight includes as you’ve heard Columbia, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador. On the flight down from Air Force One, Mr. President, I told you I was on the phone with my counterpart in the Netherlands, the Dutch national security advisor. They’ve been part of this coalition fight. And they’re very proud to be partnered up with Customs and Border Patrol, DEA, the Coast Guard, our military working in the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific, where we’ve all had a huge effect.
Robert: (24:25)
In addition to this operation, the Colombian led operation Orion 5 in partnership with the United States has disrupted or seized approximately 50 additional metric tons of cocaine that would have otherwise come into our country Mr. President. So President Trump has been resolute in his commitment to protecting the American people from the scourge of narco terrorists and traffickers. Our military deployments in the Caribbean and in the Eastern Pacific will endure. Those profiting from illicit drugs and the destruction of our communities will be brought to justice. The United States will continue its maximum pressure campaign on the Maduro regime, which has a criminal hold over Venezuela.
Robert: (25:02)
And I can tell for the Venezuelan people, when I speak with President Trump, he asks almost every day, how are things going in Venezuela? What can we do to help the Venezuelan people? This operation is part of that effort. Venezuela is a narco state led by a corrupt criminal illegitimate regime. And the people of Venezuela are suffering because of Maduro. Mr. President, you’ve been committed to cutting off his financial lifelines, identifying ways to continue to support the Venezuelan people and ensure the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid to those same people that are suffering.
Robert: (25:34)
So for those of you in Venezuela, I can let you know that President Trump continues to stand with you. He stands with interim President Guaido. The democratically elected national assembly and all the people that are fighting for their freedom and their basic human rights and a restoration of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela. President Trump’s fight against drugs and narco trafficking in the Caribbean and in the Eastern Pacific are good for the United States of America. They’re good for the people of the region, including Venezuela, but they’re also good for the entire world. So Mr. President, it’s an honor to serve with you in this effort. Thank you for all that you’re doing, sir.
President Donald Trump: (26:10)
Thank you very much, Robert and James, please.
Edward: (26:12)
President Trump as your principal drug advisor, thank you for your commitment and your leadership on the drug issue. I echo your thanks to the men and women who wear a uniform, whether it’s the military or whether it’s our state and local law enforcement partners who are stopping these deadly drugs from entering our country and thus saving American lives. You laid out a comprehensive strategy to prevent drug use before it starts, to get more people into treatment. And importantly, as we’re talking about today to stop these drugs from coming into our homeland. At your direction, we’ve implemented a whole government approach. We’ve made record investments and we’re taking real action, which meant you have received and more importantly, the American people have received real progress.
Edward: (26:59)
We must recognize these drug cartels are trying to take advantage of the pandemic and you are not letting that happen. You are making certain that those people who are suffering and risk death are making sure that we are taking the steps necessary to protect them. That’s why your leadership in this step is so important. You’re sending a clear message that this administration, that this country will not let up in our fight against drug traffickers. You’re doing it also with our international partners. For the first time Columbia, I recognize the work done there. They eradicated 13,000 hectares of cocaine in one month, last month in June. And that is before they begin the aerial eradication that we have talked about so often.
Edward: (27:46)
We cannot let these drug traffickers take advantage, especially these cocaine traffickers that are coming up through this AOR. The surge operations are effective and they’re going to continue. And we are going to take the fight to these drug traffickers. You have relentlessly committed to the American people by making investments of $36 billion for both the military fight, our law enforcement fight, as well as treatment. And of course, one of the signature programs of the first lady, something that’s really been led by Kellyanne Conway of speaking to the American people about the dangers of drug use. The media campaigns that she and the first lady have done have really made a huge difference in what has happened. And so I’m very appreciative to be our colleague of hers. We rely on Admiral Fowler, Admiral Schultz. Admiral Fears and Master Chief Audette as the ones who are out there actually taking the risk, taking the dangers for the American people. We appreciate what you all are doing and we urge you to continue to be relentless. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (28:50)
Thank you very much. And Douglas and Henry, if you’d like to say something, go ahead. Would you like to start? Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (28:56)
Thank you, Mr. President, appreciate the opportunity. I’m proudly serving at JIATF South and I’ll tell our workforce is ecstatic about the assets that are coming down into our theater. Our morale is very high.
President Donald Trump: (29:08)
Good.
Speaker 1: (29:09)
Our workforce is working relentlessly, as you said, sir. To make sure that we are building our immune system and keeping it good so we can work throughout this COVID crisis. They’re doing a great sacrifice to their families at times, but they do it because they believe in the mission that we’re doing and we want to stop these transactions.
President Donald Trump: (29:27)
So you’re working on your immune system?
Speaker 1: (29:29)
Yes, sir.
President Donald Trump: (29:30)
That’s an interesting one. Not too many people have heard that one. I like that. What do you do for your immune system? Stay in shape.
Speaker 1: (29:36)
Absolutely, sir. Working out, hydrating properties.
President Donald Trump: (29:38)
That’s good.
Speaker 1: (29:38)
And staying safe-[crosstalk 00:29:39].
President Donald Trump: (29:38)
I’m going to have to start doing that, I think. That’s a good idea.
Speaker 1: (29:39)
And we’re doing it and we’re proud to do it. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (29:46)
That’s great. No, that’s great.
Speaker 1: (29:46)
And then lastly, I’ll tell you our men and women in the military we really appreciate, and 3.1% pay raise you gave us this year. It means a lot to our men and women who work hard and going in harm’s way all across the globe. So thank you so much, sir.
President Donald Trump: (30:00)
Well, thank you. And Mario, obviously had a good immune system because …
President Donald Trump: (30:03)
Well, thank you. And Mario, obviously had a good immune system because you recovered. Wasn’t pleasant, but you got there, right?
Mario: (30:08)
I don’t recommend that as a dietary-
President Donald Trump: (30:09)
No, it’s not good, but you did a good job.
Mario: (30:12)
And by the way, thank you for your kind multiple calls while I was-
President Donald Trump: (30:15)
Absolutely. Well, you’ve been my friend. Thank you very much [inaudible 00:00:18]. Please.
Douglas: (30:19)
Sir, thank you for coming down today. As your tactical commander down on the edge of this operation, I’ve been in this mission space for over 30 years, I’ve never seen this many resources applied to the problem set of transnational criminal organizations and counter-narcotics operations. So we have under our roof, 21 different countries represented by their foreign liaison officers. They come to work every day, trying to lean into this problem set. We’ve got a whole of government from the US government with a completely joint force from all the branches of the service, as well as all of our inner agency partners from all the departments and agencies and beyond what’s represented in this room. And so we’re just grateful for the opportunity to lean into the problem. And I can tell you with surety that we’re targeting and we’re getting after this every single day. So thank you for your time, sir, and the resources.
President Donald Trump: (31:16)
Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it, Douglas. And we have the best equipment that we’ve ever had as a military. We spent two and a half trillion dollars on our military and some of it’s arriving, some of it’s coming in, but much of it’s here. So when you say the quality of equipment, we definitely have the best equipment we’ve ever had. We have the best equipment anyone has as a military. We have things under construction that we’re going to take a look at one day soon, where we have missiles that go, I hear, 17 times faster than any other missile and the normal type at least, and it’s something that nobody has anywhere in the world, 17 times faster. So it’s a little hard to spot it when it goes that fast because by the time you spot it, it’s gone.
President Donald Trump: (31:59)
But we have things happening that nobody has even thought about. So thank you very much. You’ve done a fantastic job. You’ve all done a really fantastic job and it’s an honor to be here. I want to thank all of the folks behind me too. I don’t want to be rude because you’re more important than all of us, right? But I want to thank you all very much. Great job. Really great job. Great to work with you and with you and say hello. Tell them to get well fast, right? Great man. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Admiral, it’s yours.
Admiral: (32:32)
Mr. President, thank you for the time and the attention and the resources. And we’re going to stay at this mission. It’s a 24/7 and we are going to take the fight to the enemy. Leadership here is committed to American people. We owe it to the future. And thank you.
President Donald Trump: (32:51)
You’ve done a great job. Thank you very much. Thank you, Admiral. Thank you Admiral. Thank you."
"Jul 9, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:23)
Well thank you very much please. Great honor to be with you in the beautiful Rose Garden on a sweltering day but I do want to thank you all for being here as we proudly launch the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative. Very exciting. Very exciting.
Crowd: (00:47)
Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (00:47)
Thank you. With this very exciting new effort, we will deliver a future of greater promise, opportunity and freedom for our nation’s really it’s a treasure. You are a treasure. The Hispanic-Americans and the Hispanic-American community is a treasure. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:06)
We’re thrilled to be joined today by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Thank you Betsy, thank you. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, thank you Wilbur. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, thank you Ben. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza. Thank you. Jovita. Very popular, Jovita, and Representative Mike Garcia. Good, thank you. Thank you. Congratulations Mike. That was a big win. Biggest in 22 years they say. First time in 22 years.
Donald Trump: (01:46)
That’s a good one. Well you got something special going, right? Thank you Mike. Great job. Yesterday I was delighted to host my friend President Lopez Obrador of Mexico here in the White House in a firm but close and continued friendship between the United States and Mexico. It’s never been better. The executive order that I will sign in a few moments will expand our efforts across all the federal government to deliver educational and economic opportunity for Hispanic-Americans.
Donald Trump: (02:20)
At the heart of our strategy to create a prosperous future for every Hispanic-American as well as all Americans is a great family of education. We are going to have a tremendous program and we have and you know we’re a believer in choice, choice. The other folks don’t believe in choice and choice is a great civil rights issue and maybe the great one of our times.
Donald Trump: (02:46)
I’m going to fight to ensure that every Hispanic-American parent has the freedom and the right to send your child to the public, private, charter, faith-based, magnet, home, or independent school of your choice and school choice is an incredible issue in many ways. It’s a political issue, I agree. Most people agree with us. The smart ones definitely agree with us but it’s also a moral issue and it really is a fundamental issue of civil rights. No American student should ever be trapped in a failing government school which has happened so often for so many years. It’s one of the problems you see when you see these cities going up in flame.
Donald Trump: (03:33)
One of the most successful educational models is the charter school which has been under unceasing attack from the radical left. Charter schools, charter schools have been incredible, but they’re under attack and you know why they’re under attack. More than one million Hispanic-American children currently attend charter schools and nearly one in three charter school students is Hispanic-American. I’m proud that under my administration, we’ve delivered over $1.5 billion for public charter schools. That’s a record.
Donald Trump: (04:12)
As long as I’m president I will never let your charter schools be taken away from you, be taken down. I will never let you down. I will never let Hispanic-American or any American down. That I can tell you.
Donald Trump: (04:27)
Under our leadership, the Hispanic-American high school graduation rate has reached an all-time high in the history of our country and the dropout rate has reached an all-time low in the history of our country. We have also delivered a $1 billion grant for minority-serving institutions including Hispanic-serving institutions of higher learning. Our new Hispanic Prosperity Initiative will also expand access to trade school, something that’s been really badly missing, trade schools. So important. Work-based learning and vocational education, so important. Vocational. When I was young, growing up, I used to see vocational school, Edison Vocational School. That meant people with a great talent but a talent different than history and math and other things but they had the same talent or far greater than many of the A students that studied other things. Vocational school. Great people, great talent, and they do very well, they do very well.
Donald Trump: (05:37)
Through our pledge to the American worker, we have already made available 16 million apprenticeships and training opportunities to the jobs of tomorrow. To bring jobs and prosperity to our most distressed communities, we created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones. That’s been a great success, a tremendous. Tim Scott of South Carolina has helped us so much. Which have already brought nearly $100 billion in investment to neighborhoods where millions of Hispanic-Americans live and you see it, so many of you already today, in speaking with you, you said what a difference that made. Before the plague from China came in, you know what that is, it’s the China virus. Before it came in and hit us, we achieved the lowest Hispanic-American unemployment rate and the lowest poverty rate ever recorded. History of our country ever recorded and we’re getting back to it very quickly. We achieved the highest ever incomes for Hispanic-Americans and many other American groups and communities. We built the greatest economy in history, not only for our country but for the world. We were number one by far. China had the worst year in 67 years. They weren’t happy with what was going. They were going in the wrong direction, and then the plague came in.
Donald Trump: (07:00)
Together, we will do it again and we will do it very quickly and we’re already doing it. We will achieve a swift, full and complete recovery for Hispanic-Americans and the Hispanic-American community and we’re doing it very, very rapidly. Our strategy focuses on sheltering the most vulnerable, including older Americans and nursing home residents while allowing those at lower risk such as young and healthy children in many cases, the immune system is so powerful, so strong, but the young and the healthy to safely return to work and to school. We have to open our schools. Open our schools. Stop this nonsense. We open our schools. Germany, Norway, so many countries right now. They’re opened, the schools are open and they’re doing just fine and they’re opening in the fall. So we have to get our schools open. Denmark, Sweden. We have to get our schools open and stop this political nonsense and it’s only political nonsense. It’s politics. They don’t want to open because they think it will help them on November 3. I think it’s going to hurt them on November 3. Open your schools.
Donald Trump: (08:20)
At the same time, we’re unleashing the scientific brilliance of our people. We have multiple effective therapies in use already with more being developed and you have to see some of them. The results are looking incredible and we were on track to produce a vaccine in record time and very, very soon. It’s going to be announced I believe very, very soon. So we have therapies and we have vaccines. Utilizing these advances an the skill of our doctors and nurses, we have dramatically reduced mortality rates. We have among the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world. Done a great job, whether it’s ventilators or anything you want to look at, testing. We test so many people that we have more cases. Everybody says we have so many cases. That’s because we test so many people. We’re up to approximately 40 million tests going up to 45 very quickly. So we have tests, other countries don’t do tests like we do, so we show cases. Other countries don’t show cases, but what we do have is we have perhaps the lowest but among the lowest but perhaps the lowest mortality rate, death rate anywhere in the world. That’s a tremendous sign as to what we’re doing and what our doctors have learned and the kinds of things that we’re using. It’s an incredible number, statistically an incredible number.
Donald Trump: (09:42)
A policy of never-ending lockdowns, month after month would ultimately do more harm than good to public health and so bad for our children. As a result, it really is more loss of life. We can’t do that. We have to get back now. We did it right. We saved millions of lives by what we did. We shut it down, we saved millions of lives. I put a ban on China. Heavily infected. I put a ban on Europe very early, both of them very early. We saved millions of lives, now it’s time to get back to work. A lot of people were against those bans and now they admit, most of those same people admit that ban was the greatest thing. It saved so many lives.
Donald Trump: (10:27)
Crucially we realized that the health of a nation’s economy is fundamental to the health of its people. In the last two months we have begun the fastest economic comeback in history, including an increase in Hispanic-American employment, of more than 2.1 million jobs. That’s a record. The Hispanic Prosperity Initiative will help build on this program. I will be naming a leader of incredible vision, former Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico, John Sanchez and I know he’s here. John, I’d love to have you come up and say a few words please. Thank you very much.
John Sanchez: (11:09)
Well thank you Mr. President. What an honor it is to be here with you and everybody else here in our nation’s capital. Let me say from a young boy who grew up in absolute poverty, the youngest of eight kids with a single mother, I understand what it is for the challenges facing all families but especially Hispanic families in this country, but because of her leadership through personal responsibility, stay in school, get a good education, we have lived the American dream. As a young boy I used to go and search for cardboard boxes out of the trash cans of grocery stores because we didn’t have the soles, Mr. President, on our shoes. We would hope and pray that it wouldn’t rain so the cardboard wouldn’t melt on our way to school. Here now almost 50 years later I stand next to the most powerful man in the world and the most powerful city in the world at the White House with all of you fine folks. Today, I have lived the American dream. I look at my brand new black shoes. That’s the American dream.
Donald Trump: (12:05)
Nice shoes.
John Sanchez: (12:05)
Mr. President, your leadership when it comes to job creation, education reform, choice when it comes to education, will allow this country to fulfill its American dream. I’m honored to be here with you Mr. President. Your great leadership making America great. We stand with you, we’ll keep America great under your leadership. God bless you. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (12:24)
Thank you John. Great job John. Thank you very much. Great honor. I will also be appointing the CEO and president of Goya Foods, Bob Unanue, please. Please, Bob. Thank you very much Bob.
Bob Unanue: (12:43)
Good afternoon Mr. President. Good afternoon everyone. It’s such an honor and such a blessing to be here in the greatest country in the world, the most prosperous country in the world, and we continue to grow and that’s what we’re here to do today. Our company was founded in 1936 by my grandfather, who left Spain at only 18 years old, did not know where he was heading, but he was heading and looking for opportunity and prosperity and he found it in this great country.
Bob Unanue: (13:19)
Today our company is a multi-billion dollar company, with thousands of employees and with facilities all around the globe. We have a tremendous group of what we call la gran familia Goya, the great Goya family, and these are people, I told the president earlier, we haven’t gone back to work, we never stopped working because when I asked our group, our family, “This is going to be a tough thing.” They said, “Look Bob, if we don’t do it, nobody will,” and they stood up and they worked and we continue to work, day and night, to provide much-needed food and nutrition to this country.
Bob Unanue: (14:07)
Today, it gives me great honor and by the way, we’re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder and that’s what my grandfather did. He came to this country to build, to grow, to prosper and so we have an incredible builder and we pray, we pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country, that we will continue to prosper and to grow.
Bob Unanue: (14:40)
Today, I have an announcement to make that the grand familia Goya wanted to share with all of you. There’s a great need today in food banks around the country. Food is being depleted. Hopefully as the summer ends we have new crops coming forward but right now there is a shortage. So our employees and some partners we have in the industry wanted to donate one million cans of Goya chickpeas and a million pounds of food. These are all products made in the United States, steel, from United States steel, sealed in containers, [inaudible 00:15:22] in Arkansas donating food, our farmers and again all of our products, a lot of our products are grown here in the United States made in America, and we’re very proud to give back to this nation to the food banks which we’re going to be needing some of that important food. Something that we do all year but in particular at this special time, we wanted to make that gift. So God bless you all, we hope that we continue to prosper and grow in this great country and give thanks to God. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (15:58)
Thank you Bob. Thank you. Thank you Bob. That’s very nice. We’re also grateful to be joined by future commission members standing behind me, Mario Rodriguez, Steve Cortes, Lourdes Aguirre, Jose Fuentes, Cassandra Garcia, [inaudible 00:16:22] Chris Garcia, Jesus Marquez, David [Olivencia 00:16:29], Alfredo Ortiz. Thank you all very much for being here. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:36)
Great. Great group of people. We just had a fantastic meeting. Hispanic-Americans are cherished members of our national family. They have been an integral part of building this country throughout all of American history. Over generations, Hispanic-Americans have started countless small businesses, inspired our communities and served our country in every way imaginable. As police officers, service members, motor patrol agents, pastors, teachers and business leaders, they’re incredible.
Donald Trump: (17:08)
Now Hispanic-Americans are watching as the cities they helped build, the communities they help police, the businesses they created, and the dreams they pursued are being threatened by an extreme movement that wants to tear everything down. At the center of this movement is an aggressive effort to defund the police, if you can even believe that. Defund the police, think about that. It’s a sad, sad thing. These people are crazy. They are crazy. Which would inflict great harm on our hardworking Latino communities. Great great harm. Many immigrants came to the United States in order to leave countries where the rule of law had been eroded and they don’t want those same conditions to be replicated here. They don’t want them back. They know what it is firsthand. They know what happens when the police cannot protect the innocent. When the rule of law is destroyed, when justice becomes an instrument of vengeance. Hispanic-Americans, they know. They’re hardworking patriots who support our police, protect our communities and believe strongly in the rule of law. I will stand arm and arm with the Hispanic community to ensure that every child in America can grow up in safety, security, dignity and in peace.
Donald Trump: (18:36)
We believe that the timeless principles of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution are all shared and they have to be shared in a big, beautiful heritage of all Americans. Whether you’re a first generation American or a fifth generation American, this is your home. American history is your history. It’s about you, it’s about your family, it’s about our country and the American dream belongs equally to you. American heroes inspire us all and their legacy falls to all of us to cherish and to protect and to revere. Every American, no matter your background, is entitled to a government that puts your needs and your families first. Americans of all walks of life are united by the same noble ideas and the same fundamental designs for good schools, strong families, safe communities, and abundant opportunity and I will not rest until we have delivered this future for every community, not only the Hispanic community which is doing so well, but every community in our land. Together we will write the next great chapter of the American adventure and we will defend the greatness of America for your children, for your children’s children, and for generations to come.
Donald Trump: (20:05)
Before signing this executive order which is such an important executive order, I’d like to invite Secretary DeVos to come up and say a few words followed by Administrator Carranza. Please come up, Betsy. Thank you.
Betsy DeVos: (20:26)
Thank you so much Mr. President for your leadership on this initiative. As you have noted education opens the door to prosperity and opportunity and Hispanic students like all students need to have the freedom and choice to find their education fit. Mr. President, you have led in advancing opportunity for Hispanic students by supporting Hispanics serving higher ed institutions by expanding the opportunities for charter schools by expanding the D.C. opportunity scholarship program right here in the district and there’s still more to do. Because all Hispanic students across our country need to have the opportunity to choose their right education fit. They need to have school choice. We know this is broadly supported by Hispanic families. 80% of them support this notion of insuring their children and their grandchildren have that opportunity. So thank you Mr. President for your leadership in ensuring that all Hispanic students hae that chance at the American dream.
Donald Trump: (21:31)
Thank you.
Betsy DeVos: (21:31)
Thanks Mr. President.
Jovita Carranza: (21:45)
I can’t believe I blinked at you, President. Thank you Mr. President. It’s a tremendous honor to be part of an administration so dedicated to helping Latino entrepreneurs during this extraordinary time in our country. As the daughter of first generation Mexican-Americans, I know firsthand how important opportunity is toward promoting upward mobility and enabling the American dream. Creating opportunities is the central goal behind the president’s new executive order, establishing the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, designed to help Hispanic Americans reach their dreams through innovative education and career pathways. Under your leadership, Mr. President, Latinos have been the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in the country and we want to see that continue. [Spanish 00:22:40].
Donald Trump: (23:53)
Hey Mike, maybe you’d come up just and say a real quick word because it’s about setting records out here but come on out. This man is such a big star now. California, you won in California. You got to be good, a Republican. Going to have a lot of Republicans winning in California, Mike I think, please.
Mike Garcia: (24:21)
I hope so. I think it’s the beginning of something great in California personally Mr. President. Thank you for the honor of being here today. It’s a huge honor to be here with my Hispanic brothers and sisters, leaders in your communities, leaders in your respective businesses. I am the American dream. I am a first generation American. My dad immigrated here from Mexico when he was nine years old. I had the opportunity to serve my country in the U.S. Navy, flying the most powerful strike fighter jets in the world, the F-18 [inaudible 00:24:51] aircraft carriers and combat operations, and now I’m sitting here as a member of Congress on the lawn of the White House.
Mike Garcia: (25:01)
I’d like to just echo the president’s comments that now is the time where we need to unite as an Americans and really realize what this fight is all about. It’s about freedom, it’s about liberties, it’s about fighting like it’s 1776 all over again. That’s how real this fight is. So I’m proud to be here. I’m proud to be serving my country again at this most critical time in our nation’s history, and Mr. President, thank you for your leadership. Brothers and sisters, thank you for being here today.
Donald Trump: (25:27)
Thank you very much.
Mike Garcia: (25:27)
Huge honor. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (25:32)
Ben Carson, please come up just for a minute. Say a few words. Ben, you’ve done such a great job. Thank you very much.
Ben Carson: (25:42)
Thank you Mr. President and thank you all for being here today. You know it’s so important, the emphasis that you have placed on opportunity and you ask the White House Council on Opportunity & Revitalization to look at those communities that were particularly affected in the COVID-19 and we look to that and not just the fact that there was more hypertension and diabetes, obesity, asthma, but to look another layer underneath that and to deal with that and that’s what we’re doing under your leadership.
Ben Carson: (26:24)
Every single person in our society is worth saving. We only have 330 million people. Sounds like a lot but it’s a quarter of what China has, a quarter of what India has and we’re going to have to compete with them in the future so we need to develop all of our people and your emphasis on education and educational choice will be the thing that really distinguishes and liberates our people so thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (26:56)
So now I’m going to go and sign a very important document, one that we’ve been working on for a long time and I just want to congratulate the Hispanic-American community. Incredible people, thank you very much and God bless you all, God bless America. Thank you very much.
Speaker 10: (27:09)
Mr. President, will you take some questions from us?"
"Jul 8, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:08)
Thank you very much, everyone. It’s a nice hot day to put it mildly, so we’ll make this quick, but it’s all very positive, that I can say. It’s my tremendous pleasure to welcome everyone to the White House with my good friend President López Obrador of Mexico. We’ve had a very outstanding relationship. Mr. President, we’re truly moved that you chose to make your first foreign visit since taking office very successfully, taking office, I might add, to be with us at the White House.
President Donald Trump: (00:43)
The relationship between the United States and Mexico has never been closer than it is right now, and as the president said a little while ago, people were betting against that. They were actually betting against that, but it’s never been stronger, never been closer. We’re doing tremendous job together. We’re cherished friends, partners, and neighbors. Our cooperation is founded on mutual trust and mutual respect between the two of us and between our two countries, and we honor the great dignity of both nations.
President Donald Trump: (01:16)
With this visit, President López Obrador and I have the opportunity to strengthen the bond we afford since his impressive election victory more than two years ago, a victory the vice president and Ivanka joined in celebrating at the swearing in. That was a very exciting day for them. Each of us was elected on the pledge to fight corruption, return power to the people, and put the interest of our countries first. I do that, and you do that, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (01:47)
That tradition of great respect between Mexican and American presidents goes back to the early days of both of our nations, and in particular, it includes President Abraham Lincoln and President Benito Juárez, who each held one another in very, very high esteem. They were great friends, and they did great things together, and we are grateful that this morning, President López Obrador laid a wreath at the memorials that stand to each of these leaders right here in our nation’s capital. That was very beautiful, beautiful ceremony.
President Donald Trump: (02:26)
Our countries are linked by trade and travel, by history and culture, by faith and family. The United States is home to 36 million incredible Mexican American citizens. Mexican Americans uplift our communities, and they strengthen our churches and enrich every feature of national life. They are hardworking, incredible people. They are also great business men and women and make up a big percentage of our small business owners, and very successful. They’re very, very successful. They’re like you. They’re tough negotiators and great business people, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (03:02)
Working alongside President López Obrador, we’re taking this relationship to new heights and building a powerful economic and security partnership. Together, we have addressed many of the most complex issues facing our two countries that really went unresolved for many years, and frankly, far too long. Should’ve been resolved long before I got here. But we’re achieving great strides and remarkable breakthroughs and strengthening our relationship for decades to come. With everything that we have accomplished, the potential for the future of the United States and Mexico is unlimited, far, far greater situation, really, for both countries than anyone thought possible.
President Donald Trump: (03:46)
Today, we celebrate the historic victory we achieved together just days ago when NAFTA was officially terminated, one of the worst trade deals in history, and replaced with a brand new, beautiful USMCA. We want to thank Canada also. I spoke with and will be speaking to the prime minister in a little while. While NAFTA has slashed wages and eliminated jobs, the USMCA includes groundbreaking labor protections for workers in both nations.
President Donald Trump: (04:18)
This landmark agreement will bring countless jobs from overseas back to North America, and our countries will bear very big beneficiaries. We are already seeing the fruits because it’s started. It’s the largest, fairest, and most advanced trade deal ever reached by any country, and it will bring enormous prosperity to both American and Mexican workers, and Canada. We want to thank everybody. We’ll have a separate day with Canada coming down at the appropriate time, but we want to congratulate Canada and the people of Canada, the prime minister. But this has been a tremendous achievement. It’s actually the largest trade deal ever made. We made a big one with China too, but this is the largest trade deal ever made.
President Donald Trump: (05:04)
Our two governments are also in close cooperation to stop the illicit cross border flow of drugs and guns, cash and contraband, and very importantly, stopping human trafficking. We’re forging critical partnerships across the Western Hemisphere to combat the cartels and the smugglers and to ensure safe, humane, and lawful migration, and we’ve been helped greatly by Mexico on creating record numbers in a positive sense on our southern border. It’s been really very, very tight and done a great job. I want to thank secretary who’s here. We have… Chad, you’re here someplace. Where is Chad? What a good job you’re doing, Chad. It’s a great job. We’re proud of you. You’ve worked very closely with Mexico. I know you were just telling me what a great help they’ve been. Thank you very much, Chad.
President Donald Trump: (05:56)
We’ve also worked in the battle against the coronavirus together, saving countless, thousands of lives. It’s been my honor to help Mexico procure 600 ventilators, and it’s going to be a higher number than that. They needed them very badly, and we were able to make them. We’re making thousands a week, and we’re helping a lot of countries, but one of the first and maybe the first that I spoke to was Mexico. We have a lot of them in Mexico saving a lot of lives. Mr. President, we’re in this fight together, and we’re doing very well.
President Donald Trump: (06:31)
Just a couple of things on that. I’m proud to further announced that the US is by far number one in testing, number one in the world in testing, and that the mortality rate is the lowest or just about the lowest of any nation anywhere in the world. We’re safely reopening our country, and very importantly, we’re safely reopening our schools. We want the schools to be open and going in the fall. Most of them, I think, are looking at it that way. It’s very important. We’re finding out that learning by computer is not as good as learning in the classroom or learning on the campus. I think you’re finding that too. We want to learn in the classroom, so our schools, we want them open in the fall.
President Donald Trump: (07:14)
Following President López Obrador’s remarks, we’ll sign a joint declaration committing ourselves to a shared future of prosperity, security, and harmony. This is truly a proud moment in history for both of our nations, Mexico and the United States. With the signing, we pledge the close and continued friendship between the United States and Mexico, and we accelerate our progress toward an even greater tomorrow. That’s what’s happening, a greater, maybe even a far greater tomorrow with a prospering region of flourishing hemisphere and two sovereign nations, thriving, growing, and excelling side by side, working together, and that’s what we’ve been doing.
President Donald Trump: (07:57)
Mr. President, we look forward to hosting you for a beautiful dinner later on this evening with some of your friends from Mexico and some of our great friends from the US. It’s an honor to have you with us. Please, we’d love to have you say a few words. Thank you. Thank you very much.
President López Obrador: (08:21)
[Spanish 00:08:21].
President Obrador: (08:22)
Friends, ladies and gentlemen, I truly celebrate this meeting with you, President Trump. My visit, to a great extent, has to do with importance right now in these times of world economic crisis, the importance of the enter into effect of the Mexico-US-Canada agreement to make by, Spanish acronym, USMCA. Having been able to close this deal constitutes a great accomplishment benefiting-
President Obrador: (09:02)
A great accomplishment benefiting all three nations and our peoples. As it is well known, North America is one of the most important economic regions of the planet. However, our region is an explicably a region of trade deficits. We export to the rest of the world about $3.6 trillion, but we import about $4.2 trillion. That is we have a deficit of $611 billion, which is translated into capital flight, less opportunities for companies and businesses and jobs source losses. This new agreement seeks to reverse this imbalance through greater integration of our economies and improvements in the functioning of productive chains to recover the economic presence that North America has lost in the last five decades. Suffice it to say that in 1970, the region constituted 40.4% of the world GDP. And now this share in the global economy has gone down to 27.8%. That’s why this agreement is a great option to produce, create jobs and foster trade without having to go so far away from our homes, cities, states, and nations.
President Obrador: (11:36)
In other words, import volumes of our countries, imports to the rest of the world may be produced in North America at a lower transportation cost with reliable suppliers, reliable vis-a-vis the companies of course and the utilization of regional labor force. Of course, it’s not a matter of closing our countries to the world, it’s a matter of taking advantage of all the advantages that we have because we’re neighbors as well as the enforcement of a good policy of cooperation for development. This agreement allows us to attract investments from other places of the hemisphere bringing those investments to our countries. Provided we comply, we honor the principles of producing merchandises with high regional content and also trying to have salary and labor conditions that are fair conditions for our workers of the exporting or importing countries of consumption goods.
President Obrador: (13:06)
It’s also important to point out that this agreement signifies the integration of all three countries, because we’re all contributing with productive capacity, markets, technology, experience, expertise, highly skilled labor force and we end up complimenting each other. For instance, Mexico has something which is extremely valuable to make this economic integration effective and to boost this integration. Economic and commercial integration in the region I’m talking about is very young, creative and responsible labor force. Let us not forget that the participation of workers in productive processes is just as important as the role of businesses and companies. It really would be no good for us to have capital and technology if we don’t have good workers that are outstanding workers because of their imagination, their talent and their mistake when they do their work.
President Obrador: (14:22)
On the other hand with this type of agreement and respecting our sovereign states, instead of distancing ourselves, we are deciding we’re opting to walk together towards the future. We want to privilege understanding that’s why we’re united and we’re setting aside differences, or we are solving those differences through dialogue and mutual respect. Certainly in the history of our relations, we’ve had perhaps moments in which our minds have not been together and there have been problems that are not yet forgotten. However, we’ve been able to establish explicit agreements of cooperation and coexistence.
President Obrador: (15:16)
For instance, in the ’40s of last century during the second world war, Mexico helped meet the needs of the United States in terms of the raw materials needed by the United States. And it gave it support with the labor of migrant workers that were known as the [foreign language 00:06:38]. Since then and until now we’ve been consolidating our economic commercial trade relationship, as well as our very peculiar coexistence, cohabitation sometimes as destined neighbors and other times as very affectionate and close friends. And it is also well known history or geopolitics this neighborhood we have and economic circumstances of both of our nations have promoted in a very natural manner, a process of migration of Mexican men and women coming here to the United States.
President Obrador: (16:21)
And here we’ve been able to create a community of about 38 million people, including the children of Mexican parents. It is a community of good working people, good people, working people who have come here to make a living in a very honest fashion and they have so much contributed to the development of this great nation. Furthermore, in Mexico, more than in any other country of the world we have in our society, a million and a half of U.S. citizens. They live there and they’re part of our society. So we’re not just united by geographic proximity, we have economic, commercial, social, cultural and ties of friendship. President Trump, as in the best times of our political relationship during my mandate as president of Mexico, is that of remembering this insult or things like that against me. We have received from your president Trump understanding and respect. Some people thought that our ideological differences would inevitably lead to confrontations. Fortunately, this has not been the case-
President Obrador: (18:03)
Fortunately, this has not been the case. And I believe that towards the future, there will be no motive or need to break our very good political relationship or the friendship between our two administrations. The best president Mexico has ever had, Benito Juarez Garcia, as you have mentioned, had a good understanding with the great Republican president Abraham Lincoln. Let us remember that this great historic leader of the United States who was the promoter of the abolition of slavery, never recognized Emperor Maximilian imposed in Mexico through the intervention of the powerful French army. It is no coincidence that Juarez lamented Lincoln’s murder in the United States, saying, “I have deeply felt this disgrace because Lincoln who was constantly working in such a determined manner for the complete freedom of its fellow men was worthy of a better fortune or luck.”
President Obrador: (19:24)
The same thing happened with the splendid relationship that Democrat president Franklin Delano Roosevelt had with our Patriot precedent, General Lazaro Cardenas. The same situation took place. And after the oil expropriation, in a letter, General Cardenas recognized the good understanding, the good bilateral understanding as follows. He said, “My administration believes that the attitude of the United States of America in the case of the oil company expropriation reasserts once more the sovereignty of the peoples of this continent, that with so much efforts been maintaining and the situation and the position of his excellency, Mr. President Roosevelt.” So with all proportions and all the circumstances with different circumstances, history tells us that it is possible to understand each other without arrogance or extremisms.
President Obrador: (20:45)
Now that I have decided to come to this meeting with you, President Trump, we had a good debate in my country on the convenience of this trip. I decided to come because I have already expressed, it is very important for us to be launching this new agreement. But I also wanted to be here to thank people of the United States, its government, and thank you, President Trump for being increasingly respectful with our Mexican fellow men. And to you, President Trump. I want to thank you for your understanding and the help you’ve given us in issues related to trade, commerce, oil, as well as your personal support for the acquisition of medical equipment that we needed urgently to treat our patients of COVID-19.
President Obrador: (21:50)
But what I mainly appreciate is that you have never sought to impose anything on us, violating our sovereignty. Instead of the Monroe Doctrine, you have followed in our case the wise advice of clusters and prudent George Washington, who said, “Nations should not take advantage of the unfortunate condition of other peoples.” You have not tried to treat us as a colony. On the contrary, you have honored our condition as an independent nation. That’s why I’m here, to express to the people of the United States that their president has behaved with us with kindness and respect. You have treated us just as what we are, a country and a dignified people, a free democratic and sovereign people. Long live the friendship of our two nations. Long live the United States of America. Long live Canada. Long live our America. Long live Mexico. Long live Mexico. Viva, Mexico."
"Jul 7, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you. [inaudible 00:00:08]. Well, thank you very much. It’s an honor to be with everybody, and very importantly, we’re at the White House. There’s no place like the White House, and for those of you that this is the first time, I know exactly what you’re thinking, because I was here a first time, and it was still something I’ll never forget. So it’s great to have you, and our First Lady and I pleased to welcome everybody to this wonderful place and discuss the vital importance of safety and reopening America’s schools.
Donald Trump: (00:42)
We want to reopen the schools. Everybody wants it. The moms want it. The dads want it. The kids want it. It’s time to do it. Our mortality rate is right now at a level that people don’t talk about, but it’s down tenfold, tenfold. So you look at deaths are way down from this horrible China virus, and it’s a disgrace that had happened. Shouldn’t have happened, but it did. The economy is coming back, and it’s coming back strongly. Jobs are setting records for … Two months ago, they set the record, and then again, almost five million new jobs last month, which is a record. It broke our last record of a month before.
Donald Trump: (01:29)
So the numbers are happening much faster than anybody anticipated. The stock market, NASDAQ just had another record today, and the market’s generally just really a very small amount below where they were at the height of the market when we first had to do this about four and a half, five months ago. It’s incredible what’s happened.
Donald Trump: (01:52)
When you look at education, my administration has approved $13 billion for state and local education. We’ve approved over $6 billion to support colleges and another $6 billion in emergency grants to students, very importantly. We waived standardized testing requirements, deferred federal student loan and interest payments. So you take a look at the student loan program. We’ve waived student loan and interest payments, and that is something that people haven’t been hearing about and nobody talks about, but it’s a big deal.
Donald Trump: (02:28)
We’ve pioneered new treatments that are dramatically improving the health outcomes. Vaccines are doing very well. Therapeutics are doing very well. The therapeutic research has been incredible, and I think you’re going to have a lot of big things happening long before the end of the year on both vaccines and therapeutics. Therapeutics, I guess, is a little bit of a word we can use for on the way to a cure. But they make you better. I mean, to me, the therapeutic is even more important than the vaccine at this point, because people will get better.
Donald Trump: (03:02)
But the numbers, the testing numbers are the highest they’ve ever been. We’re almost up to 40 million in testing and 40 million people, which is unheard of, far more than any other country, many times what any other country has, and therefore we have more cases. Because we’re doing more testing, we have more cases. If we did half the testing, we’d have far fewer cases. But people don’t view it that way.
Donald Trump: (03:26)
What they have to view, though, is if you look at the chart, and maybe Mike has it, but we looked at it before. If you look at the chart of deaths, deaths are way down. So what we want to do is we want to get our schools open. We want to get them open quickly, beautifully in the fall. As you know, this is a disease. It’s a horrible disease, but young people do extraordinarily well.
Donald Trump: (03:52)
I was with the governor of New Jersey. We were talking, and he said out of … and he mentioned a number, which is a very high number, but it’s a number nevertheless, thousands of people. There was only one person that died that was under 18 years old in the state of New Jersey, and that was somebody I guess had a problem with perhaps diabetes or something else. But one person out of thousands of people, one person died who was under 18 years old.
Donald Trump: (04:21)
So that’s a pretty amazing stat when you think of it. But I’d like to now just give the mic to our First Lady. She’s going to say a few words, and then we’re going to go with Mike and Karen Pence. Then we’ll go around the room a little bit, say a few words, and Kelly Anne, you did a great job this morning. Thank you. Really great. So if I might, First Lady, please.
Melania Trump: (04:44)
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The first pillar of my Be Best initiative is children’s wellbeing, and taking care of children’s social, emotional, and physical health has never been more important than during the COVID-19 pandemic. The administration has worked around the clock to protect Americans from the coronavirus, but many challenges for children and families can be just as invisible as the virus and just as dangerous.
Melania Trump: (05:20)
When children are out of school, they’re missing more than just time in the classroom. They’re missing the laughter of their friends, learning from their teachers, and the joy of recess and play. For children with disabilities without access to technology or whose homes are not a safe place, the situation can be even worse.
Melania Trump: (05:47)
As the start of the school year gets closer, I encourage parents, teachers, and school to teach children about the importance of CDC guidelines and to implement them when appropriate. Children’s mental health and social development must be as much of a priority as physical health. The same is true for parents. Many will be forced to make stressful choices between caring for their children and going back to work, and we must address those needs as well as their own mental health and wellbeing.
Melania Trump: (06:27)
As we continue to come together as Americans to tackle these challenges, I’m honored that you could all be here today to offer your thoughts. I look forward to working with you to make sure that Americans, children, and families can be healthy and thriving. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (06:49)
Thank you very much. Governor, thank you. I see you sitting over there. What a job you’re doing.
Governor Parson: (06:54)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (06:55)
Thank you very much for being here. I appreciate it.
Governor Parson: (06:57)
Proud to be here.
Donald Trump: (06:57)
Thank you, Melania, very much. We just heard Mike was telling me that Governor DeSantis is doing a terrific job. He just announced that the schools will be open in the fall, and we hope that most schools are going to be open. We don’t want people to make political statements or do it for political reasons. I think it’s going to be good for them politically. So they keep the schools closed, no way. So we’re very much going to put pressure on governors and everybody else to open the schools, to get them open. It’s very important. It’s very important for our country. It’s very important for the wellbeing of the student and the parents. So we’re going to be putting a lot of pressure on open your schools in the fall. Mike, please.
Mike Pence: (07:45)
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for your leadership. I have seen it day in and day out since you asked me to lead the White House coronavirus task force, and today’s just one more installment in your commitment to make sure that our states and our families have all the resources they need to meet this moment, our healthcare workers are provided for, but also understanding that we’ve got to reopen America and reopen America safely.
Mike Pence: (08:18)
But we convene all of these great leaders from around the country today, Mr. President, because you know that to open up America again, we need to open up our schools again, and I want to thank all those gathered here for their efforts as well. I know I speak on behalf of my wife, Karen, and I also want to express our profound gratitude to the First Lady. Throughout this pandemic, her regard for families, for children, for the emotional impact that this has had on every American is so admirable, and I’d like to invite everyone to show your appreciation for our First Lady and the work she’s done. Mr. President, since the moment that we asked the American people to step up, to take efforts to slow the spread, and in that 15 days that would become 45 days, we encouraged people to refrain from attending school, if possible, to engage in school from home whenever it was possible.
Mike Pence: (09:34)
There were two categories of heroes that emerged. One was the parents around America who stepped up as never before, and those that are looking on, those that are represented here should know your President, the First Family, your Vice President, and our Second Family are grateful for the families of this country and everything you’ve done to be the teachers for your children, to create the structure at home where they could continue to learn, even in a challenging time.
Mike Pence: (10:02)
I also want to say how grateful we are to the teachers, Mr. President, and I’m actually sitting next to one who I’ve been married to for 35 years. As you know, she actually teaches in a local school in the Washington area a few days a week, and I watched her go in and pack up crates of art materials the children could come by and pick up and take home to continue their learning. So I’d like to invite everybody to show your appreciation for the parents and all the great teachers who have done the work of continuing to educate our children throughout this pandemic. It’s truly been [inaudible 00:10:36].
Mike Pence: (10:41)
Mr. President, the American people deserve to know that while we are seeing rising cases across the Sunbelt, at your direction, we’re ensuring that States have the resources, the support, the supplies and personnel that are actually arriving as we speak in states like Texas and Florida and elsewhere to relieve healthcare workers. To your point, I hope the American people appreciate the point that you made yesterday on the national stage and did so again today, that because of what our healthcare workers have done, because of the innovation and the medicines that we’ve been able to make available, literally we have seen fatalities decline by 90% from some of the worst moments of this pandemic, and we’re going to continue to work each and every day to continue to keep those losses low and steady. We’re going to save lives as we reopen our country.
Mike Pence: (11:33)
Today, Mr. President, as you know, we spoke to the nation’s governor on the topic of this summit, and we reflected on the fact, as now 47 governors and the governors of two territories have announced plans to reopen schools across America, that it’s important to do so for a variety of reasons. The First Lady just spoke of this. We ought to well be concerned about children falling behind academically, and there’s no substitute for in-classroom learning, for in-person learning, and that’s been much discussed at the summit today.
Mike Pence: (12:13)
But as the American Academy of Pediatrics, so well represented here today, recently reflected, there are social costs, emotional costs, and even physical costs to our children across this country that we spoke to the governors today. It’s important that we reopen our schools as you’ve directed for the academic and the intellectual development of our children. But it’s also vitally important that we remember, as Dr. McCance-Katz told the governors today, that seven million American children suffer from either a mental illness or emotional disturbance, and they principally receive the care from health and mental services at their school. So making sure that we’re meeting the mental and emotional needs of our children, as well as making advances academically is what brings us here today.
Mike Pence: (13:12)
The last thing I’ll say to all those gathered here, Mr. President, is from early on, you have directed our taskforce and the CDC to equip families and schools and states with the resources to operate. It was as early as March 12th that the CDC issued its first guidance for strategies for school and childcare services. We issued decision trees in the middle of May, and just last week, I’m pleased to report the CDC published new guidance for K-12 schools and higher education regarding the type of testing that is appropriate and other strategies.
Mike Pence: (13:51)
Mr. President, we can bring our schools back. Next week, the CDC is going to issue five new documents, How to Prepare Communities to Return Safely, Decision-Making Tools for Parents and Caregivers, Symptom Screening, Cloth Face Coverings in School Settings Guidance, and the rest. We’re going to continue to flow these resources and this guidance. But as Dr. Redfield told all the nation’s governors today, and I want to acknowledge Governor Parson’s leadership and his presence here today, we’re truly grateful, is that what you’ve instructed our task force to do and the CDC to do in this moment is to say to states around the country and the local communities, “We’re here to help.”
Mike Pence: (14:35)
The CDC has issued guidance, but that guidance is meant to supplement and not replace state, local, territorial, or tribal guidance. In a word, Mr. President, you’ve made it clear to us. We don’t want to be the reason any school doesn’t reopen. So our words to the parents that are looking on, to teachers that are looking on, administrators, leaders in your community is that we are ready to work with the leaders in your school system and in your state to find a safe and responsible way to reopen your schools.
Mike Pence: (15:13)
That’s our commitment, Mr. President. We’re continuing to move out on that on the belief that to open up America again, we’ve got to open up America’s schools, and the American people are taking important steps every day, including this summit today, to do just that. I’m truly grateful for all of those represented here for being a part of this important work. With that, I’d be happy to recognize Mrs. Pence for a few comments.
Karen Pence: (15:42)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mike and Melania. I had the privilege of addressing this group earlier today and kind of opening up your summit, but I do want to say thank you to all the teachers. I know at my school, everybody quickly learned how to do online teaching. It wasn’t something that our teachers across America were familiar with, and I just applaud them. They have worked so hard, and the parents really are the unsung heroes. They really had to quickly get up to speed, and it was not easy to do, but our kids are struggling. They need their friends, and they need their teachers. They need their routines.
Karen Pence: (16:32)
This decision to open up the schools greatly impacts our children. It impacts them academically, it impacts them socially, and it impacts them emotionally. So I applaud what you’re doing here today, Mr. President, because our kids, for their mental health and their academic health, they need to be back in school. So thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:57)
Well, thank you very much, Karen. I appreciate it, and I see Dr. Redfield over in the audience. I appreciate it, and I know you’d like to see everybody coming back and getting back to school in the fall. I’ve read everything you’ve written, and I appreciate that very much, Doctor. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Governor, please. Maybe we’ll go around the room real quickly. We’ll go quickly, and we’ll get everybody to say a few words. We’ll start with our governor.
Governor Parson: (17:22)
Thank you, Mr. President. As you said, when you come here, I’m just honored and humbled to be here, sitting with you, the Vice President, First Lady, and the Second Lady. Those dreams you think about someday, never imagine them being reality, but here we are. So it’s an honor to be here today.
Governor Parson: (17:40)
Let me first start off by just saying thanks to the President and the Vice President for what they’ve done over the last … well, since they’ve been in office, to say the least, but over the last 17, 18 weeks, they’ve been on the phone every week. The President himself has been, and I don’t mean for five minutes to say, “Hello, governors, and see you later.” In-depth conversation with governors across the state. The Vice President has been there for almost 17 to 18 weeks.
Governor Parson: (18:07)
I know that I’ve been following with them, and the one thing they stressed every day on those phone calls, every week, they’re trying to do the best thing for this country and for the everyday people out there. They were trying to make their full support to the governors across the state. I just want to thank you for doing that-
Donald Trump: (18:25)
Thank you.
Governor Parson: (18:25)
… for leading is what good leaders do at times of crisis. I just want to thank you for that. When the President said he was going to put a little pressure on governors to open these schools up, I will tell you this. On a few phone calls I’ve had with him, he can put a little pressure on you, if he decides to do that. I will say that on that. So sometimes we all need a little push to get things going.
Governor Parson: (18:50)
What the First Lady said when she talked about the kids was so important to me as a grandparent, as a father. I sit there and I think of all the kids that need to be in school. There’s the ones that have the privilege of going every day. That’s almost common that we go to school, for most of the school kids, but a lot of school kids, it’s a safety blanket. It’s a way to get nutrition. It’s a way to get counseling. It’s a way for somebody to help them when they cry out for help, and that’s also why getting schools back open is so important.
Governor Parson: (19:20)
Then if you want to take that one step further, it’s about making sure people are going to be qualified for the workforce of tomorrow. This virus cannot shut our country down and our states down. We have to deal with it, as we would anything else that we’ve dealt with in this country, and we have to move forward. Economy and life goes on, and education is part of who we are. Kids need to get back in school. Parents need to get more involved in their schools and be back, involved in their schools. As I heard speakers today speak, it’s part of who we are. It’s how we build a future, and I think that’s so important.
Governor Parson: (19:55)
I also want to thank the Second Lady for giving me a little inspiration on a couple of key bills we signed in Missouri, and I want to give you a little credit today. We did full reciprocity in the state of Missouri yesterday. I signed that bill, and full military reciprocity. The Second Lady kind of gave me a little inspiration for that, and also, my daughter’s a schoolteacher [inaudible 00:00:20:13]. Most of the time, we have a father-daughter relationship, except when it comes to teaching, and she becomes a senior advisor to the governor when we talk about those issues on that.
Governor Parson: (20:24)
But, again, I just want to thank the President for his support for our state. People appreciate it, Mr. President. I want you to know that, for the First Lady and for where we’re headed in this country, because we’ve went through hard times before, and we’ll continue to get through hard times. We’ll be better off for it, and we’ll be stronger than ever. So thank you.
Donald Trump: (20:42)
You won’t be changing the name St. Louis, will you?
Governor Parson: (20:45)
No. We will not be doing it.
Donald Trump: (20:47)
Thank you. Thank you very much. That’s very important. Thank you very much.
Dr. Sally Goza: (20:52)
Good afternoon, Mr. President. I’m delighted to join you, the First Lady, the Vice President, and the Second Lady here today to talk about why it’s important for children to be in school. My name is Dr. Sally Goza.
Dr. Sally Goza: (21:03)
Important for children to be in school. My name is Dr. Sally Goza. I am a pediatrician from Georgia and I am president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children get much more than an education at school. Being away from peers, teachers, and school services has lasting effects for children. Although this will not be easy, pediatricians strongly advocate that we start with the goal of having students physically present in school this far. Of course returning to school must be done safely. We must take measures to keep students, teachers and staff safe, and with flexibility to adapt as needed to the community’s prevalence of COVID-19. The evidence we have so far indicates that children are less likely to have symptoms or severe disease resulting from coronavirus. Children are less likely to become infected and they are less likely to spread infection. We know however that missing school can have serious consequences for child health and well-being, particularly for students with disabilities or with special healthcare needs. Students who are in school learn more than reading, writing and arithmetic. They also learn social and emotional skills, get healthy meals and exercise, and mental health support. Schools help identify and address learning deficits, physical abuse, substance use, depression and suicidal ideation. These are all critical reasons to get children back to school.
Dr. Sally Goza: (22:25)
Reopening schools in a way that maximizes safety, learning and the well-being of children will clearly require new investments in our schools. We urge you to ensure that schools receive the resources necessary so that funding does not stand in the way of keeping our children safe or present at school. Thank you Mr. President. We look forward to working with yo and all the people around this room.
Donald Trump: (22:47)
Thank you very much. Please.
Penny Schwinn: (22:51)
Thank you Mr. President. Penny Schwinn from the great state of Tennessee. I appreciate the invitation on behalf of our superintendents, our districts, our families, our teachers and our public officials. Opening up Tennessee, we know that reopening schools reopens our economy. We’ve got great examples of where superintendents have come together [inaudible 00:23:08] rescheduling to make sure the parents can get back to work for companies who support multiple regions. We’ve done an incredible job with resources, 20+ toolkits. We’ve opened up free professional development for teachers and principals for free statewide and online tools. I’d also like to just thank the First Lady for her support on child well-being. We had a wonderful conversation a couple of weeks ago under the task force that we’ve launched statewide covering the entire state and making sure that all of our children receive a high quality public education as well as being served in terms of nutrition, transportation, et cetera. I’ll just end by saying as the proud daughter of a police officer and a teacher, I was raised with safety and high quality education being two fundamentals in my home and it’s a great honor to be able to reinforce that with the schools in Tennessee today.
Donald Trump: (23:53)
Thank you very much.
Penny Schwinn: (23:54)
Thank you sir.
Donald Trump: (23:55)
Great. Thank you. Alex.
Alex: (23:57)
Well thank you Mr. President. Really thanks to the historic response that the president has led to this unprecedented pandemic, we have the tools where we can reopen our workplace. We can reopen our schools and we can reopen healthcare. We’ve got the tools. When we think about kids and schools, the school for our children is a center of so much of their life. It is where they get healthcare, it is where they get mental healthcare, it is where many of them get nutrition. It is where mandatory reporting of child abuse and sexual abuse happens most often because of the nature of mandatory reporting requirements, in addition to the social, physical, intellectual development that the kids need from a physical setting in schools. We’re at a very different place now than we were two or three months ago. We have the world’s most robust testing system with close to 40 million tests having been done. We have health system capacity and personal protective equipment to enable us to work through these outbreaks that we’ve got. We’re advancing on therapeutics as the president said. We now have Remdesivir for hospitalized patients, steroids for lung illness. We have convalescent plasma to treat individuals and just this morning the president made a major half billion dollar investment in a monoclonal antibody that will be a treatment that if successful and if approved could deliver hundreds of thousands of doses as early as late summer early fall.
Alex: (25:34)
We have three vaccine candidates and just this morning invested $1.6 billion in a fourth vaccine candidate that could deliver hundreds of millions of doses this fall and into early next year. So it’s just a very different circumstance than we ever had before. We know more about this virus, the fatality rate is going down because we’re better at taking care of patients with the virus. Our fatality case rate in the United States is among the lowest if not the lowest in the developed world right now, and we can reopen our schools safely with what we know and it’s really simple practices of common sense. It’s social distancing, it’s wearing face coverings when you’re in a setting that you can’t social distance, and it’s practicing good personal hygiene. The tools are there to bring our kids back safely, to protect our teachers and our staff, and it’s time to do it now.
Donald Trump: (26:28)
Thank you Alex. Good luck with all of the therapeutics. I know you’re getting very close. Very close, that would be incredible. What are your chances early, like in September?
Alex: (26:39)
So Regeneron which is the one that we funded at almost half a billion dollars this morning, they are one of the most advanced. We have several very advanced monoclonal antibody products. This basically takes that convalescent plasma that recovered patients would donate and bio-engineers that and effectively unlimited supply that we can do and so it’s a cocktail of multiple antibodies to give you immune system an immediate defense and we’re studying it both for preventing disease as well as stopping the progression of the disease. So it’s really very exciting.
Donald Trump: (27:10)
It seems to be just working. It’s sort of the ABCs of what we’re doing and it seems to be working. Do you have tests right now that say it does work?
Alex: (27:21)
Well you got the initial trial work that Regeneron did and that’s why we’re investing in the late stage development of it but then we have these other three therapies that thanks to your leadership we have so many more tools than we had three months ago in terms of therapeutics. We don’t want anyone to get sick, but we have much better ways to take care of individuals now than we did three months ago.
Donald Trump: (27:43)
That’s exciting, very exciting, all right. We’ll hold you to it, September. You too doctor. Please, thank you.
Patrick Daly: (27:56)
Good afternoon Mr. President, I’m Patrick Daly, the principal of St. Vincent de Paul High School in Petaluma, California in Sonoma County. I just want to tell you what an honor this is to be here this afternoon. I want to thank you, thank the First Lady, Vice President Pence and Second Lady for your leadership of our country. Really during a very difficult time [inaudible 00:28:18] the First Lady’s love and protection of children. Very important to me and being the father of four kids, three daughters and a son, it is very important. We plan on opening April 10. That is our focus. I think that we have put a plan together that is a working document with all the safety documents and policies in place to ensure that St. Vincent de Paul opens following all the guidelines that are recommended. I think that as you stated earlier this should never be political and I think that at times it has become very political and many school systems throughout our United States, I think probably particularly in California.
Patrick Daly: (29:03)
So we are very excited about the possibilities of the fall and we have three plans. One would be the reopening which we plan August 10, then a hybrid plan which is two days on one day off two days back in, and then as I mentioned earlier God forbid if we had to go back to the distance learning, I just don’t think it’s beneficial to boys and girls 14 to 18 years of age and particularly I really feel for the parents of elementary school children who are trying to work and provide for their families and at the same time having to stay at home and teach. It’s very difficult, I hear that a lot from our own elementary school but I can’t thank you enough for your leadership of our country and thank you for this honor.
Donald Trump: (29:46)
Well good luck with your plan and getting them open and hopefully you could do five days instead of the two and back and forth. I know you want to be able to do that, so you’ll try.
Patrick Daly: (29:55)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (29:55)
Thank you very much. Great job. [inaudible 00:29:59] good looking person, this is, huh?
Cameron Vaughan: (30:02)
Mr. President … There we go. Hello Mr. President, I’m a student at St. Vincent de Paul High School, my name’s [Cameron Vaughan 00:30:21] and I personally just want to thank you for both inviting me and helping to reopen schools. Coming on behalf of the students, it really means a lot just to be able to get back out and it means a lot to our emotional health and our mental health just to be out there with our friends because a lot of us don’t have that opportunity, and it helps reopen our schedules so we have something to look forward to. Me, I’m a person of schedules. I run by a schedule, make a schedule for myself. So I just want to thank you very much for getting us back to that.
Donald Trump: (30:55)
Great job. Really great. Thank you very much. We’ll get you back, okay? We’ll get you back soon. Thank you. Kellyanne, please.
Kellyanne: (31:02)
Mr. President, Mrs. Trump and Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Pence, thank you very much. I listened to Cameron Vaughan and I’m reminded why we’re here, why we’re here in this room today on this very important topic but why we’re here in this administration. I believe the hallmark of the Trump-Pence administration has been the success in looking out for and expanding opportunities, safety and well-being for the forgotten child and the forgotten child took on a new meaning during this global pandemic. Between the first and third weeks of March of this year, just about 100% of our schoolchildren across this country of all ages were taken out of their schools and stuck at home. We saw a few things happen, many of which have been spoken about today but I’ll add one more. The digital divide was laid bare in that so many of our students could not access basic digital assets to allow them to confidently and competently complete their schoolwork and to learn and to thrive. The schools are our central nervous system because our students are the heart and soul of our nation and so today your message is, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, that all children matter and our mission is to make sure that all children can safely and securely re-enter their places of learning very soon.
Kellyanne: (32:18)
This has also impacted our economy and I have a soft spot for single moms having been raised by one and our single moms have been disproportionately impacted through their job security, their wage earning, and most of them are not in jobs for which they can telecommute. So we’re creating pandemics within this pandemic. The good news is that our children are at low risk for transmission even as they are at high risk for maladies visible and invisible. The great news is that as we safely reopen our schools we are in keeping with so much of your agenda Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Trump and Mrs. Pence which is to preserve and expand educational opportunities to respect the dignity of all students but to respond to the individual needs of all of those students by expanding school choice and charters and educational freedom and opportunity scholarships, allowing them to have more options as they go through their lives, beginning with the quality and solid education.
Kellyanne: (33:16)
The president has said if we as a nation can win two World Wars, dig out the Panama Canal, put a man on the moon, then we certainly ought to be able to deliver a quality education to each child and that begins with reopening our schools and making good on that promise to each and every one of them. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (33:33)
Thank you. Thank you very much Kellyanne.
Jenny Beth Martin: (33:36)
Hi Mr. President. I’m Jenny Beth Martin with Tea Party Patriots. Thank you and thank you Mrs. Trump and Mr. Vice President and Mrs. Pence for having me here today. While I am with Tea Party Patriots, I’m also a mom and my children are sitting right over there so thank you for having us here today. Mr. President, you were right and I hope you will trust your instincts. America is not meant to be shut down and we have to reopen schools this fall. I have been in touch with almost 1,000 doctors from around the country. I helped Dr. Simone Gold spearhead a letter to you signed by 800 physicians and surgeons who talked about the side effects of the lockdowns. I’ve done a second letter with over 150 doctors, 240 nurses, 330 educators, 70 national groups and thousands of parents and concerned Americans who want to see schools reopened.
Jenny Beth Martin: (34:44)
Reopening schools is going to stabilize our society. I think it’s the number one most important thing we can do to stabilize our society from top to bottom, whether it is in a local community, just re-establishing calendars, which churches, non-profit groups, traffic patterns, people who don’t have children, care about the calendar for schools. Kindergartners and elementary school students simply cannot learn looking at a Zoom screen. If they could we wouldn’t need schools in the first place. We could just plop them in front of a television. The last place in the world a middle school student needs to be is online unsupervised by adults. They bully each other when they’re in front of teachers. You can’t even imagine what’s going on with social media right now. Young adults and high school students are losing hope and optimism for the future and in February they had so much and now we look, we turn on the television and we can see the destruction that that lack of hope and optimism is causing. Employers have to rebuild their companies. They need employee at 110% to be able to do that. We did everything we could to flatten this curve and we have to roll up our sleeves now and rebuild our companies, but we can’t do that when employees are dividing their time between taking care of their children indefinitely for who knows how long and trying to get their job done.
Jenny Beth Martin: (36:20)
I have one employee who has five children. His wife is a dental hygienist. I’m granting him as much grace as I possibly can, which is easy to do, he’s a wonderful employee, but I can’t even imagine what it would be like to have five children and all of a sudden have to homeschool them all. It’s not even homeschooling, it’s helping them with digital learning. Homeschool parents [inaudible 00:36:48] we’re careful about not conflating the two. For me, I’m a single mom now. In 2007, ‘8, and ‘9, I went through financial crisis. My then-husband’s business failed. We lost our house, we lost our cars, we lost everything. I cleaned houses to help make ends meet. I’ve done everything possible to rebuild. I know what those families who are now unemployed are facing, trying to divide their time between taking care of their children, not knowing if their children are going to be educated, and figuring out what they’re going to do with their life is the hardest … It’s incredibly difficult. For people who think, “Oh we can just work at home or we’re essential, you’re an essential employee,” it sends the wrong message. Every single person in this country is essential. We are the United States of America. Every one of us is essential. Every one of us is important and we … Not every single family can afford a computer so that their children can be online at the same time or WiFi as Kellyanne was just talking about to be able to do Zoom all at the same time. So families are suffering and the education is suffering as well. As a single mom, this situation is ripping me in two. You cannot be in two places at once, physically or mentally, and I’m doing the very best I can to take care of my children, their father when they’re living with their father, he does a great job taking care of them, but when they’re with me, I’m doing everything I can to take care of them, help them prepare for their senior year of high school, make up prom, dealing with whatever else we have to deal with from the shutdowns, and run a company and work.
Jenny Beth Martin: (38:47)
It’s impossible. It’s impossible to do what we need to do, so the schools must be reopened. It will stabilize our country. I cannot thank you enough for doing this today and sending this message and the doctors who I’ve been working with, they want to do anything they can to help calm the fear that is permeating our country. They understand we have to have a healthy respect for the virus and we have to be able to live our lives and they and I will do anything we can to help you with that. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (39:20)
Thank you very much. Great job. Looks like you’re doing a good job. Is your mother doing a good job? She good, right? You said the right thing. Okay, great job, thank you very much.
Dr. Lisa Piercey: (39:32)
Mr. President, First Lady, Mr. Vice President, Second Lady. On behalf of the great state of Tennessee and Governor Bill Lee, I want to thank you for all of the help and resources and support that you and your administration have provided us. You guys have been accessible, you have been responsible, and that means the world to us in the states when we’re trying to do our jobs. I’m Dr. Lisa Piercey, I’m the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health. I’m also a pediatrician and a mother of four and I know very clearly that education and economic prosperity are key drivers of health. We know in Tennessee that kids have to get back to school and parents have to get back to work. It’s paramount for our economy and it’s paramount for the health of our nation, and we’re doing our part in Tennessee for that effort and thank you again.
Donald Trump: (40:21)
Yeah, thank you and say hello to Bill, please. Thank you. Doctor?
Dr. Birx: (40:29)
Thank you, thank you, Mr. President, First Lady, Vice President, Second Lady. I want to really … Today was a really terrific day because it took America’s children and put them in the center and said this is not going to be a unilateral and a unifocal and one-dimensional discussion about COVID-19 but a discussion that transcended that single moment and brought in the other issues of mental health, academic health, emotional health, and really said that it’s important to the whole child to have the availability of schooling. I think having that discussion that was multidimensional, having teachers here and students here and the health commissioners here and the secretaries here was really very helpful because I think it not only put the child at the center but also made it clear about how important these other issues are that are beyond COVID-19 and the health and welfare of our children. So the discussion was terrific and I think we have a way forward.
Donald Trump: (41:29)
Thank you very much. Thanks [inaudible 00:41:31].
Speaker 2: (41:30)
Thank you Mr. President so much for including me in today’s event. I think I’m on now. Thank you for including me so much in today’s event. I want to thank you, I want to thank the Vice President, the First Lady and the Second Lady for your comments and for all the concern you’ve head for the education of our children. I come today as a parent, as an OB-GYN physician, and as the managing partner of my practice. This has been a very scary but also a very
Speaker 3: (42:03)
And a very scary, but also a very enlightening experience to have walked through. It’s been quite the challenge, and I will say quite the challenge. But the first thing I want to say is it’s so important to get our children back in school, our higher education students, our high school students and our middle school students are so embedded in social media already. What they need is that social interaction with each other and with adults, because without that, I fear, what our society is going to look like. The preservation of society is reliant upon the interaction of these children day to day, face to face with each other.
Speaker 3: (42:41)
I also saw the anxiety of my youngest child, who’s here today with me, Macy, back on that side, I saw her anxiety when she came home from college, the anxiety of not knowing how her education would continue, and then trying to set up the zoom meetings and make it happen. But more importantly, not having the opportunity for those in-person tutorials or that interpersonal relationship with a professor to complete her courses. And I think her courses did suffer because of that. She’s a good student and it wasn’t dramatic, but I can only imagine what it was like for other students.
Speaker 3: (43:16)
My eldest child had a learning disability. To try to bring him home, and do this education online, without that in-person benefit, without the tutors being there present, would have been a disaster to his now very good career in Richmond. And I just fear for that student, especially. As we go back to school, I think it’s very important that we also educate these kids because they sometimes do rise above it and feel as though they don’t have the mortality or the morbidities or that problem of interaction with each other. They will have new family units. My daughter will be in an apartment with three other girls. They will be the new family unit. And it’s important that we educate them for that for when they come home that they realize that their elders, their grandparents, and all are now vulnerable to him, that family unit has changed, but we can do this and we can teach them. And masking, they’ve learned this it’s important, but we have to reinforce this at the college level to keep it ongoing as a priority. And I know that we can do it.
Speaker 3: (44:26)
The other thing that I, as a physician and a strong believer in, is herd immunity. And what I’m not proposing is that we put all of our students in a big VAT and only the survival of the fittest come out antibody positive. I’m not saying that. I do think it’s important to stop this tremendous isolation that keeps the virus as the winner. We need to get out, we need to have the vaccines to help us, we need to have the interaction that helps to get that immunity, so that we can protect our vulnerable, and we can protect our elderly, and we can protect those younger folks with comorbidities because we’ve got a society that is immune to the virus, and we can put the virus back in its place.
Speaker 3: (45:12)
Finally, I just want to, again, thank you for being here, thank you for hearing me out, and thank you for putting education of our children in the utmost, and for putting our economy in that place too, because as a business owner, when I have parents who have to come late or leave early in order to educate their children and yet run a business at the same time, as this lady stated, it is incredibly difficult, if not impossible, and we want to maintain their jobs, we want to maintain their work ethic, but we also want to maintain the intelligence of their children and of our future. And so I thank you again for your interest in this and for letting us be here. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (45:55)
Thank you. I think it’s very important to note that we’ve done it right. We closed up, we were amazing the way our great citizens adhered to what we wanted to do. And we saved, I think, millions of lives. Now, we want to be open. We understand the disease much better. Nobody knew what this was, nobody had ever seen it before. There’s been nothing like this since 1917. That’s more than a hundred years ago. But we saved tens of thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of lives. And now we’re opening and we want to stay open, and we will stay open, we’re not closing. We’ll put out the fires as they come out. I call them embers and fires and whatever you want to call them. But I think it’s very important to note what we’ve done, we’ve saved literally hundreds of thousands of lives.
Donald Trump: (46:45)
I was going over numbers before with the Vice President, and if you looked at a million, 2 million, two and a half million, those are all reasonable numbers to what we could have had. Right now we’re at a number, as you know, far lower than that. And where would you say we are today Mike?
V.P. Mike Pence: (47:03)
130,000.
Donald Trump: (47:06)
About 130. So we’re at 130, and we could be at a way over a million right now, and I think it could have been two and a half or 3 million people. But now we’re open, and now we understand the vulnerable, we understand who has the biggest problem with it, and we watch that group, and that age group, and also people that aren’t feeling so well with respect to, in particular, [inaudible 00:47:32] certain diseases, the diabetes is bad, the heart is bad, and we watch very closely and we’ve done it right. When you look at what happened with Sweden, I kept hearing about Sweden with the herd, with the pure herd. The herd concept of opening up and keeping open, all of a sudden, it exploded. You look at what’s going on in Brazil and a couple other places.
Donald Trump: (47:58)
So we’ve really done it right, but now it’s time to be open, it’s time to stay open, and we will put out the fires as they come up, but we have to open our schools. It’s so important to open our schools. And when you said from a psychological standpoint, with respect to staying home any longer, you can’t do it. You can’t do it. That has great dangers also. So that’s where we are, we’re not closing, we’ll never close. You’ll have certain areas that will have difficulty, and they’ll do what they have to do. And that’ll be up largely to the governors, but it’s also, they’re in very strong consultation with us. We’re supplying them with tremendous materials and gowns and masks and anything else they need, and they should be doing it themselves. But we’ve made a lot of governors look very, very good.
Donald Trump: (48:42)
We’ve made a lot of governors look very smart that weren’t so smart, and some have just done a good job right from the beginning. I could give you a list. I could grade them. I could grade them out from one to 50, and you’d be amazed. You might be surprised at some of them, both good and bad, but I thank you very much for your remarks. I think it’s very important, what you said, I think it’s very important. Please.
Sue Ellspermann: (49:03)
Mr. President, First Lady, Mr. Vice President, Karen. It’s great to be here, and to represent the Great State of Indiana as the President of Ivy Tech Community College. We are Indiana’s community college, so 160,000 students across our great State. And I just maybe want to remind you as we talk about higher education, the true workforce engine, that community colleges are for our nation and how important they are, and the students that we serve. So let me just speak a little bit. We don’t serve as much the 16 or 18 year old, though we have many traditional students. It’s often the single mother that we heard about, 29, 30 year olds and beyond, coming back part time and how important it is that they have access to community college. They’re also typically the lower income. Our first generation students are students of color, those that really do need to have the opportunity for the American dream.
Sue Ellspermann: (50:07)
So this has been incredibly important that we continue to run. And so we have, we’ve been virtual were, we were virtual this summer, and as of Monday, Vice-President, we are doing completion academies on campus to ensure that those nurses and welders and all that need the hands on and labs courses that they can be out there joining America’s new jobs that are coming and being part of a strong economy. So we’ve appreciated the great support, the Cares Act, all that’s gone on. We will operate, we will be face to face, we will be hybrid, we will be online, we will be virtual. And far our single moms will even be learning anywhere, which means that they can decide week to week if they can come on campus or be virtual or be asynchronous.
Sue Ellspermann: (50:55)
So we know we have to change to meet the needs, but we appreciate the great support of this administration. And we will continue to work on behalf of ensuring that this economy has the workforce and success that it needs going forward.
Donald Trump: (51:13)
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Chancellor Finis St. John: (51:19)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m Finis St. John. I’m the Chancellor of the University of Alabama system, which includes the University of Alabama, UAB, UAH, and the academic medical center at UAB. It’s an honor to be here. I appreciate your hosting this. When this pandemic started and we had to send all of our students home from our universities, many of us were afraid that this would be the disruption of higher education for all time, that they would learn that they could learn as well on their computer from home as they would on their campuses.
Chancellor Finis St. John: (51:52)
One thing this has taught us is we’re not worried about that anymore. Our students are yearning to come back to campus. They want to be there, it has reaffirmed the value of on campus instruction at our institutions of higher learning. So last month, our board of trustees committed to returning this fall on all three of our campuses to in-person instruction, realizing that we could not eliminate all risk, we can reduce risk and manage risk in a way that allows us to go forward. So early on, we looked to the medical experts at UAB, the researchers and scientists and doctors there, to try to come up with a plan to make our campuses as safe as possible, and as safe as any in the country. And we’ve got a four part pillared program that allows us to do that.
Chancellor Finis St. John: (52:49)
The first, and we believe this is important, is to try to have all of our students tested before they returned to campus. Not after they returned, but before they return, so that those who need isolation can do that at home, and we can begin the school year. Second our UAB folks and our people on all three of our campuses have developed a symptom tracking app that’s used on the phone, it takes 20 seconds to sign up for, and 10 seconds every two or three days to follow up on, to track symptoms. We also have a program to trace contacts that will allow us to manage student outbreaks during the year. And then last, a Sentinel testing or a sample testing program throughout the rest of the school year.
Chancellor Finis St. John: (53:40)
What this does is not only we hope allow us to reopen our schools, but to keep them open, which is going to be the hardest part I want to thank you and the Vice President for the assistance that we have received through these federal programs. Without those, it would have been very difficult for our medical center to continue, for our campuses to make it through these difficult times, and to allow us to have testing in place for our students this fall. So we promise to do our best to provide this essential service to our students and our citizens, and we greatly appreciate the assistance that you’ve given us.
Donald Trump: (54:18)
Well, thank you very much. It’s a great place, a great State. And you’re right about one thing, there’s nothing like the campus. If we’ve learned anything, the computer will never replace the campus. They thought it would for a while, didn’t they? But it didn’t. After about two weeks, we figured out that it’s much better to have it the old fashioned way. That’s great. Great statement actually. Thank you.
Speaker 4: (54:42)
Thank you Mr. President, Mrs. Trump, Mr. Vice President and Mrs. Pence. I’m a third grade teacher at Blessed Sacrament Catholic School right here in Washington. I believe Mr. Vice President you mentioned some heroes shortly a go. I certainly agree with you, the parents, I couldn’t have done this for the past few months at home without the community of parents that we have at Blessed Sacrament School. And I guess the teachers are heroes in their own way. I really believe that the real heroes here are the students. The students that plugged along, that rose to the occasion. In fact, one of my students is here today, Rory stand up, and that’s why I’m here. They showed incredible resilience in spirit, and all of the gifts that God has given them. I really believe that the children are our future, as I know that you do, and I think that they are what is truly going to make America great again. So I want them to be back in school in the fall. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (55:57)
Great. We agree. Thank you. Please.
Speaker 5: (56:01)
Mr. Trump, Mr. President and First Lady, Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence. First, I just would like you to know that I personally pray for you daily, all four of you. I cannot imagine the burdens on your shoulders. And I know that it’s only through God that you can handle that.
Donald Trump: (56:20)
It’s not easy.
Speaker 5: (56:25)
I so appreciate all that you’ve done. I am the President of our school board in the Great State of Ohio in Cincinnati Indian Hill. And we are very actively working to get our children back in school, full time, all together, as safe as possible. We are fortunate that we have a lot of resources and we’re able to do that. My biggest concern, and I hope through your leadership we will not have overregulation at the local level that would keep us from being able to accomplish that goal. My biggest fear is that we will get everybody back, we’ll get into a routine, and then because of regulations and mandates that we would have to close back down, or to send children home, and that is a very big concern. That would be just such a disruption on top of a disruption. So that is probably my biggest concern.
Speaker 5: (57:27)
I’m also very happy to hear that University of Alabama has made the statement to go back to school. I have two college athletes and we’ve been waiting all summer to know what’s happening at that higher education level. And it’s disruptive, they’re going into their senior years, and internships were canceled, and it’s a scary time. That’s a scary time anyway, on a good day, for a young person. So I really hope that our higher education institutes will make some decisions soon. And really I’m just honored to be here. I appreciate so much what all of you have done, and however we can help please don’t ever hesitate to reach out.
Donald Trump: (58:12)
Thank you very much. And will Alabama be playing some great football? What’s going on with Alabama?
Chancellor Finis St. John: (58:19)
Mr. President, that’s not the first time we’ve heard that question. I can promise you. We were planning to play the season at the University of Alabama. Understand that that creates great difficulties and complexities, and we’re hoping for that. It’s important to a lot of people, but we’re doing our best on that one too.
Donald Trump: (58:39)
It’s true. And say hello to the coach. Great coach.
Chancellor Finis St. John: (58:42)
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (58:43)
Thatnk you.
Johnny Taylor: (58:43)
Mr. President, well, I don’t know about Alabama, but the University of Miami is going to be playing. I’d be using the house. Yes, it’s hurricane in the building. I’m Johnny Taylor, as you know, and I’m your appointee. And I want to start by saying thank you. I remember being right across the hallway in 2017, when you appointed me to be your advisor, the chairman of the President’s board of advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, HBCUs. And frankly, there were people who questioned whether or not anything would really come of that, and if you were really committed. I remembered visiting with the Vice President, Vice President in the room just across the hall, actually, and you met with 60, almost 70, of our Historically Black Colleges and University of presidents, they came to visit, and you all welcomed us.
Johnny Taylor: (59:34)
I remember meeting with Secretary DeVos early on, and there was all of this commitment to HBCU, and frankly, the naysayers didn’t think you would make good on it, the three of you, and you did. So let me start by thanking you. Thanking you for committed to the countries 101 Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and allowing me to be the chairman of the board that advises you all collectively on HBCUs. So thank you. Listen, you’ve done great by us so far, since 2017 every year our budgets have increased, but not just financially, but the true support of our institutions. And this today is yet another example of your advocacy, your support of Historically Black Colleges and Universities that is giving us the safe space to return safely to campus.
Johnny Taylor: (01:00:26)
We need to bring our students back because, frankly, without these institutions, these great institutions, many of our communities, our fragile communities will suffer in ways that people just can’t quite put their arms around. There are three things that I will point out very quickly. First of all, online education, the virtual education while it’s wonderful, it’s not as good as the in-person education in the higher education space, and our students, many of them who come from the most fragile of communities, and many of them didn’t get high quality, secondary educations, when they get to the postsecondary space, they need their teachers. They need to look across, they need to come to office hours. They need the assistance. And so we need to encourage these colleges to open so that their students can get the best education and truly experience the American Dream.
Johnny Taylor: (01:01:15)
Secondly, HBCUs are economic drivers in many of their communities. In many of these communities, they are the largest employer, and you were kind enough to create opportunities zones, but when the schools are shut down, there’s not much opportunity going on. So we need the schools to be open, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President, Secretary DeVos, so that we can get the surrounding community can go back to work. A lot of those businesses are struggling if we shut these campuses down and they’ve been struggling for a significant period of time. So it’s also just smart business, small businesses need this.
Johnny Taylor: (01:01:50)
And then finally, the entire country right now is engaged in a discussion around racial tension, and the need for diversity, and corporate America in particular wants us to do something about it. Well, HBCUs play an outsize role in helping solve for that problem. Historically, we’ve created the, disproportionately, black leaders, teachers, doctors, lawyers, judges, et cetera, far more than the 101 schools should be punching. They’re actually punching above their weight. And therefore, if we’re going to commit longterm to addressing the racial inequities and issues of discrimination in our country, HBCUs have to be a part of that. And you do that by getting these kids and these faculty members and these administrators back to work.
Johnny Taylor: (01:02:40)
So on behalf of the countries, 101 HBC use as an American, as a father of a 10 year old little girl, thank you for the commitment to get our schools back and our children back safely so that they can learn, and as I said, experience the American Dream. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:02:55)
Thank you Johnny. And you’re doing a great job. The only thing is I don’t think people know how much we’ve done for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Nobody knows that.
Donald Trump: (01:03:03)
… Done for historically black colleges and universities, nobody knows that we’ve done more than any administration in history, and nobody knows that, but maybe they’ll find out eventually. They’ll find out. But thank you very much, appreciate it. Please.
Brad Weller: (01:03:17)
I’m Brad Weller from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, seventh grade science teacher. Thank you very much, President, for being here and doing all this, First Lady, Mr. Pence, and I really, really want to thank Karen Pence for stealing all of my information I had written down this morning and then she did it again after I wrote the new stuff down just this afternoon. So I appreciate it. No, I’m going to keep this short and sweet. We’re ready to go back. We literally are ready to go back. I know our students, I know I have three kids at home. They want to go back.
Brad Weller: (01:03:54)
It’s time. It’s time. Just like your economy, which is the greatest economy ever in the history of the world. I appreciate that you had to slow it down. The momentum was gone. We did the same thing to our students last year. Their momentum was, I mean, they were rolling. They were well oiled machine. And then all of a sudden, just you had to throw it and you had to throw it in park. If we just have to change gears a little bit this year, that’s one thing we can do, but to throw it in park again, I don’t like that option.
Donald Trump: (01:04:31)
Thank you. You’re right. Thank you very much. Brooke.
Brooke Rollins: (01:04:32)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m Brooke Rollins, the president’s domestic policy chief. And while I sit here and listen to everyone, I’m struck, I don’t know that the world understands, but I think it’s so important. We have a president who was arguably one of the most successful businessmen in the history of our country. The first lady who has spent her time and her talent and her extraordinary skill on focusing on the wellbeing of children. We have a vice president who was one of the most successful governors in the history of our country and we have a second lady who has a career and is focused on being a teacher and an educator.
Brooke Rollins: (01:05:08)
This is the dream team. I don’t know that there will ever be another leadership team like the four of you to lead this country back to even greater heights than it was ever before. In March of this year, 75 million students lives and their family’s lives were up ended when they were sent home, 75 million plus families. Just a couple of months later, here we are in the East Room of the White House with some of the country’s greatest educators, leaders, teachers, HBCU leaders, coming together to figure out how to get these schools reopened, how to do it in a safe way and how to do it where we put children first.
Brooke Rollins: (01:05:48)
The good news. I’m so glad that Dr. Goza is here from the American pediatric society association, because we are now understanding that I think an analysis of 45 studies recently showed that the preponderance of evidence indicates that children are less likely to be symptomatic, have the severe disease, or be really susceptible and transmit COVID-19. And for the week ending June 27th, school aged children accounted for only 1.3% of COVID-19 related hospitalizations. The evidence is showing that it really is time for these kids to get back to school, but it really is about the mental health, the wellbeing, and the emotional wellbeing of these kids.
Brooke Rollins: (01:06:29)
But also focusing on, as this president has done, this is the last thing I’ll say, the forgotten Americans, the vulnerable Americans who are most susceptible to the ravages of what happens when we don’t get kids back to school and we don’t get kids and lives back to normal. As the mother of a fifth grader, seventh grader, eighth grader, and 10th grader, there is no doubt in my mind representing all the moms in this country that we’d really love for our kids to get back to school, but it’s about so much more than that. It’s about the wellbeing and safety and economic prosperity of this country.
Brooke Rollins: (01:06:59)
And having this dream team along with Kellyanne and Secretary DeVos, Secretary Azar, and our teams here, this country needs to know that we are fighting every single day for every American and to ensure that we can reopen safely and make sure that it’s done in the proper way. So thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:07:15)
Thank you, Brooke. Thank you very much. Please.
Speaker 6: (01:07:18)
Mr. President, Mrs. Trump, Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Pence, it’s an honor to be here representing Forsyth County Schools and Forsyth County, Georgia. We’re about 30 miles north of Atlanta, serve 52,000 students in our school system. We’re ready to go. We’re going to open our doors on August 6. We’ve been planning and preparing all summer. We will have guidelines in place. I’m really proud of our teachers and our students, how well they perform last spring. But as everyone has said this morning, this afternoon, our students need to be back in school and we will be prepared on August 6.
Speaker 6: (01:07:50)
I will assure you of that.
Donald Trump: (01:07:51)
That’s great. That’s great. Thank you very much.
Betsy DeVos: (01:07:55)
Thank you, Mr. President, Mrs. Trump, Mr. Vice President, Mrs. Pence. Mr. President, thank you for your bold leadership and for convening us here today for this vital conversation. It’s clear our nation’s schools must fully reopened and fully operate this school year. Anything short of that robs students, not to mention taxpayers, of their futures and their futures represent our nation’s future. So it’s not a question of if, it’s just a question of how. We had a good discussion today on how to ensure schools reopen and education continues in ways that keep students and teachers healthy and safe.
Betsy DeVos: (01:08:32)
Under the president’s strong leadership, our economy is roaring back. Our schools must do the same. This is the moment for American educators to rise to meet the needs of every student. Students can’t afford to fall further behind. Even before the virus, too many we’re trapped in schools that don’t meet their needs. So this is the time to reopen schools, to rethink school, to be more nimble, more agile, more responsive to students’ needs in a 21st century changing world. This moment demands actions, not excuse making or fear-mongering.
Betsy DeVos: (01:09:07)
We’ve done whatever it takes before and as Kellyanne said earlier, and as you’ve often said, Mr. President, we’ve dug out the Panama Canal, we’ve won world Wars, we’ve reduced the Berlin Wall to rubble. And thanks to you, we’ve defeated ISIS with grit, determination, and grace. We can do what’s right for all students and ensure they are back in school. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:09:31)
Thank you very much, Betsy. I appreciate it. Very nice. Please.
Nicole Washington: (01:09:35)
Good afternoon. Thank you, Mr. President, First Lady Trump, Vice President Pence, and Second Lady Pence. It’s an honor to be here. My name is Nicole Washington. I am a trustee at the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, as well as Miami Dade College in Miami, Florida. As you both well know, our schools didn’t close. In many ways, the pandemic accelerated trajectory that we were already on to use technology to expand services and programs to students. It’s not been easy. I actually had the pleasure of teaching a class, a synchronous class this summer at the University of Miami.
Nicole Washington: (01:10:13)
And I applaud all of the faculty and the staff who have had to pivot on a dime and provide these services to students. Florida A&M is actually going to open. We’re going to invite all of our students back in the fall. The board made this decision based on a McKinsey survey that found that only a third of our students would likely stay if we chose to remain remote online for the fall. Students would choose either better online options or options closer to home or more cost effective measures. And so we do want to, we are going to reopen. We do want to reopen.
Nicole Washington: (01:10:50)
I think there are obviously concerns either way. If we remain virtual, we have enrollment concerns, student engagement concerns as well as budgetary concerns. And then if we open, we have to be very cognizant and vigilant about health and safety liability concerns, as well as the cost associated with reopening. We’re very thankful for the CARES Act additional allocation for testing, tracing, sanitation. That will be a recurring cost going forward. What I would like to close on is the pandemic dispelled the myth that higher education can change on a dime.
Nicole Washington: (01:11:28)
Our institutions are printing PPE, we’ve expanded student services virtually online that we didn’t think we could do, our students are creating apps. And I hope that we encourage those innovations to continue after we returned to the new normal and provide high quality just in time services to accommodate our students’ preferences and their schedules. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:11:56)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Please.
Delanie McDonald: (01:11:58)
Thank you, Mr. President, First Lady, Mr. Vice President and Mrs. Pence for the honor of being here today. My name is Delanie McDonald and I’m the student trustee at Middle Tennessee State University. I was actually homeschooled all my life by choice, not because of a pandemic. So I really understand what people have been going through. And I was honored to receive the Buchanan Fellowship at MTSU, which is the highest academic scholarship given to incoming freshmen. I was heavily involved on campus. I actually served as a student body president as well, so I know the extreme importance that the campus environment has on student success.
Delanie McDonald: (01:12:37)
My fellow students across the nation have lost a lot this year, and it is important to all of us to safely return to campus this fall. My university has done an exceptional job of updating the students, of reassuring them that they are tirelessly working for are safe return to campus. And I’m honored to be here today included in this discussion and I’m really excited to take back what I learned to my fellow student body. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:13:02)
Thank you very much.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:13:07)
Good afternoon, Mr. President, First Lady, Mr. Vice President, Second Lady. I will brag on her. She is an MTSU student. I’m the president of Middle Tennessee State University. We attract the best and the brightest, not only in the state of Tennessee, but from around the United States. Like all the participants here this afternoon, I’m honored to be a part of this very important conversation regarding the reopening of schools, colleges, and universities. For the past 20 years, I have served as president of this great institution. We are 37 miles southeast of Nashville.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:13:54)
Our university was established in 1911 and we are right now one of the largest undergraduate university in the state of Tennessee. We have grown tremendously over the years and we are proud to be one of the Princeton Review, 2020 300 plus best universities in the United States of America. We’re doing some incredible things there at that university. We have 22,000 students, a very diverse student body, 38% of our freshmen class, first-generation and we are proud of that. 40% are low income. Average ACT score is one of the highest in the state of Tennessee.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:14:40)
We are a major comprehensive university and each year for the state of Tennessee, we produce more degrees than any university, 5,000 degrees each year MTSU issue produces for the state. Now some highlights of our decision to reopen. We stepped out. We were the very first university in the state of Tennessee to announce that we are going to reopen for the fall in person classes. But in reality, Mr. President, we never closed. Because of the nature of our student population, many of our students had nowhere to go in March when a lot of schools closed down.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:15:31)
And so we kept our residence halls open. We kept our cafeteria and we provided the same service, obviously taking consideration the virus. And so we feel that we have the experience of actually operating a university in a pandemic. We regard the health and the safety of our students and our employees as priorities. And it was really interesting as we were making this decision, we have a very active parents Facebook page, sometimes too active. We have a very active student body Facebook page and so we surveyed them. We surveyed our parents and our students and we asked them their feelings about returning and would they returned.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:16:21)
The vast majority of both our parents and our students from that survey indicated to us that they would want our university to be opened. So my executive team that made these decisions, including the doctor of our health center, we decided that we were going to put together a plan that would make our parents and our students confident. We can’t guarantee anything with regard to this virus, but we felt if we communicate with them and put a mitigation plan together and I have two of my colleagues here from the state of Tennessee, we met already and my university had a meeting.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:17:06)
Was it last week, commissioner? She brought her staff down. We have put together a very strong mitigation plan that deals with testing, contact tracing and isolation and quarantine, if needed for our students. I want to just give a brief overview of how the CARES money really helped our university, Mr. President. As we look at pivoting from in-person to online and remote, we always had a strong technology operation, but we needed to build a stronger one that would provide the quality education. So we invested $6.9 million, 3.4 of the 6.9 came from the CARES Act.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:18:02)
And this investment allowed us to purchase the newest instructional technology to facilitate teaching and learning at the university. What does this mean is that regardless of where a student is, each, every single class at our university is going to be captured electronically, and it’s going to be archived and students would be able to access those lectures at any time anywhere. Which means if a student gets sick or they have to attend to a sick parent and they can’t make it to class, they are not going to be disadvantaged as result of this technology.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:18:49)
And so we believe that it’s in the best interest of our students to open up, to provide that top quality education. We feel that for our students, our university provided 459 laptops, free laptops for our students, 673 internet hotspots free for our faculty, 101 laptops, 235 internet hotspots. And so I close with this, that we must understand the demographics, we must understand our community and indeed we must understand some of the challenges that we are going to face in higher education. And because of the demographics of our student population, we’ve worked very hard to address the issue of the desperate and disproportionate amount of minorities and people of color and low income that are being affected by this virus.
Sidney A. McPhee: (01:19:54)
And so we’ve partnered with one of the sororities, the AKAs, and they have put together an incredible package of information that will be given out to our students as they return. Thank you so much for having us and we look forward to this conversation. I learned quite a bit today. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:20:16)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job too. So I want to thank everybody. And I want to just say, get open in the fall. We want your schools open. It’s going to be a much better climate than it is right now. We’re on the right side of things. Deborah, I think we can say that. A lot of work has been done. We understand what we’re doing very, very well. Again, mortality rate, the lowest anywhere in the world, and we want to get this done and we want to get our country going again. Economically, we’re doing well. We want to do well with the education.
Donald Trump: (01:20:51)
I see where Harvard announced that they’re closing for the season or for the year. I think it’s ridiculous. I think it’s an easy way out. And I think they ought to be ashamed of themselves, you want to know the truth, but I noticed that today and probably others are doing that. That’s called the easy way out. I don’t know if people are helping them. I guess their endowment’s plenty big. They don’t have any problem with that, but that’s not what we want to do because it’s very important as so many of the parents and instructors said today.
Donald Trump: (01:21:23)
It’s so important that the children at this age, especially, that they’re together, they’re together on campus and that’s what we’re striving for and we’re going to be very strong in that. We’re going to be very, very powerful in that view. We want our schools open in the fall. Tomorrow, I’m meeting with the president of Mexico. I say that to the media because it’s going to be quite a meeting. He’s a good man. He’s a friend of mine and we have a great relationship with Mexico. So we’ll be meeting tomorrow. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:21:53)
Congratulations, everybody. Thank you."
"Jul 4, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:24)
Wow. You having a good time? Members of Congress, members of my cabinet, and my fellow Americans, the First Lady and I are delighted to welcome you to the second annual Salute to America. On this wonderful day, we celebrate our history, our heroes, our heritage, our great American flag, and our freedom. Happy 4th of July to everyone.
Donald Trump: (01:09)
I want to thank the US Army Golden Knights for that truly awe-inspiring display, tremendous talent. The Golden Knights and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening, we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nation. 244 years ago in Philadelphia, the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth that we are all made equal by God.
Donald Trump: (01:57)
Thanks to the courage of those patriots on July 4th, 1776, the American Republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional, and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. Our workers, our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity. Our artists, architects, and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty. American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the earth.
Donald Trump: (02:58)
We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing.
Donald Trump: (03:21)
Our inventors, scientists, doctors, and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions of people all around the world. Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the moon, and America will be the first nation to land on Mars.
Donald Trump: (03:48)
All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy. We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth. We inherit their towering confidence, unwavering enthusiasm, their unbridled ambition, and their unrelenting optimism. This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation, and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriot.
Donald Trump: (04:34)
That is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names have etched on our monuments and memorials and in the pages of history and in the hearts of a very grateful people. We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms. We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs. We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together we will fight for the American dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America.
Donald Trump: (05:46)
Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before. The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none. Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by these same countries.
Donald Trump: (06:17)
But there and then, we got hit by the virus that came from China. We’ve made a lot of progress. Our strategy is moving along well. It goes out in one area and rears back its ugly face in another area. But we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned how to put out the flame. We’ve made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands, to the point that we have far more than we need, and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries as a gesture of good will. Likewise, testing. There were no test for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless, results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have, not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. Now, just like everything else, we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators. We have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world, and we are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country; where heretofore, it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands and-
Donald Trump: (08:03)
It was almost exclusively made in foreign lands, in particular, China where, ironically, this virus and others came from. China’s secrecy, deceptions, and cover-up allowed it to spread all over the world, 189 countries, and China must be held fully accountable. With respect to remedies, we are now doing unbelievably well and are in deep testing on vaccines, treatments, and therapeutics.
Donald Trump: (08:46)
I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver lifesaving treatments and ultimately, a vaccine. We are unleashing our nation’s scientific brilliance and will likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year. We’re very grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the front lines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please, stand. Please. Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people.
Donald Trump: (09:54)
Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget, we are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first generation American. We want to go from first generation to 10th generation. It matters not. We are American. We are from the USA. This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first.
Donald Trump: (10:53)
We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on earth, what we have built, the United States of America, to build a future where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity.
Donald Trump: (12:13)
Our past is not a burden to be cast away. It is not a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. This incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation, picking up where the last finished, linked by time, by fate and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. These are great heroes.
Donald Trump: (13:24)
Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity. That’s what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history, and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. You slander people much braver and more principle than you. You’re slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War. You slander them. You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression.
Donald Trump: (14:54)
They didn’t fight for those things. They fought for the exact opposite. We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by you. The more you lie, the more you slander, the more you try to demean and divide, the more we will work hard to tell the truth, and we will win. The more you lie and demean and collude, the more credibility you lose. We want to bring the country together, and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one. Our country will be united after all. What do we all want? We want a strong military, great education, housing.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Low taxes.
Crowd: (16:03)
Yes!
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Law and order?
Crowd: (16:03)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (16:03)
We want safety.
Crowd: (16:04)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (16:06)
We want equal justice.
Donald Trump: (16:09)
We want religious liberty.
Crowd: (16:11)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (16:12)
We want faith, and family, and living in great communities, and happy communities and safe communities, and we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world, which has gone on for decade after decade.
Crowd: (16:30)
Yes!
Donald Trump: (16:31)
We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things? The more bitter you become, the more we will appeal to love and patriotism, and the more we will rise above your hate to build a better future for every child in our great country.
Donald Trump: (16:51)
To celebrate America’s majestic inheritance, yesterday I signed an executive order to create a brand new monument to our most beloved icons, the national Garden of American Heroes will be a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community, and from every place and from every part of our nation. Great men and great women, people that we can look up to forever. Families will be able to walk among the statues of titans, and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends, and why don’t we start with a man who’s been very unfairly treated, who twos years ago, three years ago, especially five or six years ago people would have said “It’s impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success?”
Donald Trump: (18:18)
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Betsy Ross, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, James Madison, Dolley Madison, the great Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Clara Barton, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Henry Clay, Susan B. Anthony, Booker T Washington, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are looking down, and you’re going to see some planes like you have never seen before, because we build them better than anybody in the world. The greatest air force, the greatest fighters, the greatest everything. You’re going to be seeing something. I just wonder what Orville and Wilbur would have been thinking if they ever got to see that, but they’re looking, they’re checking it out right now along with us. Amelia Earhart. A great, great athlete, no matter where he went he was the best athlete, Jackie Robinson. George S. Patton. General Patton, he didn’t know how to lose. He didn’t know how to lose. General Douglas MacArthur, Audie Murphy, the great Billy Graham. An incredible man, respected by everybody, Martin Luther King. President Ronald Reagan, Christa McAuliffe, and Antonin Scalia.
Donald Trump: (20:47)
So those are just a few of the people we’ll be naming, and things are subject to change, but once we make that decision, those great names are going to be up there and they’re never coming down. They have just been an incredible group, and we are going to do this in a very democratic way, frankly. We’re going to take names and suggestions, we’re going to have committees, and we’re going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known, the most respected people, the people that helped us the most and the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say “Isn’t America just a tremendous place?” So, thank you. That’ll be very exciting.
Donald Trump: (21:42)
The Patriots who built our country were not villains, they were heroes whose courageous deeds improved the earth beyond measure. The beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice, to heal division and to continue the work of our founding fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America. If you believe in justice, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in peace, then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our constitution. It’s our founding and our constitution. It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved. That’s why our country is so strong, even despite terrible things that happen over the generations.
Donald Trump: (22:41)
Here this evening are a number of heroes who risked their own lives to uphold these values and to keep our communities and our country safe. We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines protecting our cities, many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people. We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man, fallen officer David Dorn, a 38 year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending. And to David’s great family, I want to thank you very much. The American people will always support the courageous men and women of law enforcement, and nobody, nobody embodies that better than David. Thank you very much. Please.
Donald Trump: (24:00)
Please. And David is looking down right now, and he is so proud of you, and he loves you so much, and thank you for being here. He’s a great man. He’s a great man.
Donald Trump: (24:43)
Finally, tonight, we will salute the greatness and loyalty and valor of the men and women who have defended our independence for 244 years. We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States military. Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good. Battlefields across the world and here at home are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this earth to secure liberty and peace. Every child should be taught the military heroes who fought and died to make us free. These are great, great people. These are great, great heroes, indeed.
Donald Trump: (25:39)
And our greatest leaders and heroes should be recognized and even immortalized for coming generations to see. You know that. This will make our country even stronger, long into the future. In a few moments, we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years. These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II. They raced through the skies of Korea’s MiG alley. They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam. They delivered a swift and swip…you know that, sweeping … It was swift and it was sweeping like nobody’s ever seen anything happen. A victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one. And they’ve gone on to dangerous missions all around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safely.
Donald Trump: (27:02)
As you know, we’ve killed, this last year, the two leading terrorists of the last 10 years, al-Baghdadi and Soleimani. Killed, gone, over. We’ve worked to fully rebuild the armed forces of the United States. No enemy on earth stands a chance. $2.5 trillion we’ve invested, all made in the USA. We’ve never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now. We did that over the last three years. Everywhere these aircraft have flown, they’ve rained down American thunder, delivered American justice, and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereignty. In their steel frames, broad wings, and roaring engines, we see the story of America’s daring defiance, its soaring spirit, and undying resolve. Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried, but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence.
Donald Trump: (28:25)
We are Americans, and we never back down. We never give in, and we never give up, and we will never yield defense of our nation. We love our nation. We will only fight to win.
Donald Trump: (28:40)
Today, we thank God for the gift of life and for the blessing of liberty. We honor the legends of our history, the glories of our founding fathers, and the giants of the past, and the heroes of today who keep us safe, who keep us strong and proud, and who keep us free. Once again, happy July 4th to all. Our country is in great shape. Our military has never been stronger, and many, many good things are going to happen. Next year will be one of the greatest years we’ve ever had. I want to thank our men and women, they are so good, of the National Park Service, air traffic control, and the United States military. God bless you. God bless our heroes. God bless America.
Donald Trump: (29:37)
And now, let the flyovers begin. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Jul 3, 2020","Donald Trump: (02:20)
Well, thank you very much. Governor Noem, Secretary Bernhardt, we very much appreciate it. Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and a very special hello to South Dakota. As we begin this 4th of July weekend, the First Lady and I would wish each and every one of you a very, very happy Independence Day. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (02:52)
Let us show our appreciation to the South Dakota Army and Air National Guard and the Air Force for inspiring us with that magnificent display of American air power, and of course our gratitude as always to the legendary and very talented Blue Angels. Thank you very much. Let us also send you our deepest thanks to our wonderful veterans, law enforcement, first responders, and the doctors, nurses, and scientists working tirelessly to kill the virus. They are working hard. I want to thank them very, very much. We’re grateful as well to your state’s congressional delegation. Senator John Thune. John, thank you very much. Senator Mike Rounds. Thank you, Mike. And Dusty Johnson, Congressman. Hi, Dusty. Thank you. And all others with us tonight from Congress, thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (04:07)
There could be no better place to celebrate America’s independence than beneath this magnificent, incredible majestic mountain and monument to the greatest Americans who have ever lived. Today we pay tribute to the exceptional lives and extraordinary legacies of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt. I am here as your president to proclaim before the country and before the world, this monument will never be desecrated, these heroes will never be defamed, their legacy will never ever be destroyed, their achievements will never be forgotten, and Mount Rushmore will stand forever as an eternal tribute to our forefathers and to our freedom.
Donald Trump: (05:29)
We gather tonight to herald the most important day in the history of nations, July 4th, 1776. At those words, every American heart should swell with pride, every American family should cheer with delight, and every American patriot should be filled with joy because each of you lives in the most magnificent country in the history of the world and it will soon be greater than ever before.
Donald Trump: (06:13)
Our founders launched not only a revolution in government, but a revolution in the pursuit of justice, equality, liberty, and prosperity. No nation has done more to advance the human condition than the United States of America and no people have done more to promote human progress than the citizens of our great nation. It was all made possible by the courage of 56 patriots who gathered in Philadelphia 244 years ago and signed the Declaration of Independence. They enshrined a divine truth that changed the world forever when they said, “All men are created equal.” These immortal words set in motion the unstoppable march of freedom. Our founders boldly declared that we are all endowed with the same divine rights, given us by our Creator in Heaven, and that which God has given us, we will allow no one ever to take away ever.
Donald Trump: (07:48)
1776 represented the culmination of thousands of years of Western civilization and the triumph of not only spirit, but of wisdom, philosophy, and reason. And yet, as we meet here tonight, there is a growing danger that threatens every blessing our ancestors fought so hard for, struggled, they bled to secure. Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children. Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities. Many of these people have no idea why they’re doing this, but some know what they are doing. They think the American people are weak and soft and submissive, but no, the American people are strong and proud and they will not allow our country and all of its values, history, and culture to be taken from them.
Donald Trump: (09:17)
One of their political weapons is cancel culture, driving people from their jobs, shaming dissenters, and demanding total submission from anyone who disagrees. This is the very definition of totalitarianism, and it is completely alien to our culture and to our values and it has absolutely no place in the United States of America.
Donald Trump: (10:24)
This attack on our liberty, our magnificent liberty must be stopped and it will be stopped very quickly. We will expose this dangerous movement, protect our nation’s children from this radical assault, and preserve our beloved American way of life. In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance. If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished. It’s not going to happen to us.
Donald Trump: (11:25)
Make no mistake. This left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution. In so doing they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger, and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery, and progress. To make this possible, they are determined to tear down every statue, symbol, and memory of our national heritage.
Crowd: (12:08)
Not on my watch.
Donald Trump: (12:09)
True. That’s very true actually. That is why I am deploying federal law enforcement to protect our monuments, arrest the rioters, and prosecutors offenders to the fullest extent of the law.
Crowd: (12:28)
Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
Donald Trump: (12:48)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (12:51)
I am pleased to report that yesterday, federal agents arrested the suspected ringleader of the attack on the statue of the great Andrew Jackson in Washington, D.C., and in addition, hundreds more have been arrested. Under the executive order I signed last week pertaining to the Veterans Memorial Preservation Memorial and Recognition Act and other laws, people who damage or deface federal statues or monuments will get a minimum of 10 years in prison and obviously that includes our beautiful Mount Rushmore.
Donald Trump: (13:54)
Our people have a great memory. They will never forget the destruction of statues and monuments to George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionists and many others. The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets and cities that are run by liberal Democrats in every case is the predictable result of years of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism, and other cultural institutions. Against every law of society and nature, our children are taught in school to hate their own country and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes but that were villains. The radical view of American history is a web of lies, all perspective is removed, every virtue is obscured, every motive is twisted, every fact is distorted and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition. This movement is openly attacking the legacies of every person on Mount Rushmore. They defiled the memory of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. Today we will set history and history’s record straight.
Donald Trump: (15:51)
Before these figures were immortalized in stone, they were American giants in full flesh and blood, gallant men, whose intrepid deeds unleashed the greatest leap of human advancement the world has ever known. Tonight I will tell you and most importantly the youth of our nation the true stories of these great, great men. From head to toe George Washington represented the strength, grace, and dignity of the American people. From a small volunteer force of citizen farmers, he created the Continental Army out of nothing and rallied them to stand against the most powerful military on earth. Through eight long years, through the brutal winter at Valley Forge, through setback after setback on the field of battle, he led those patriots to ultimate triumph. When the army had dwindled to a few thousand men at Christmas of 1776, when defeat seemed absolutely certain, he took what remained of his forces on a daring nighttime crossing of the Delaware River. They marched through nine miles of frigid darkness, many without boots on their feet, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. In the morning, they seized victory at Trenton after forcing the surrender of the most powerful empire on the planet at Yorktown, General Washington did not claim power but simply returned to Mount Vernon as a private citizen.
Donald Trump: (17:56)
When called upon again, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was unanimously elected our first president. When he stepped down after two terms, his former adversary, King George called him the greatest man of the age. He remains first in our hearts to this day, for as long as Americans love this land, we will honor and cherish the father of our country, George Washington. He will never be removed, abolished, and most of all, he will never be forgotten. Thomas Jefferson, the great Thomas Jefferson, was 33 years old when he traveled north to Pennsylvania and brilliantly authored one of the greatest treasures of human history, the Declaration of Independence. He also drafted Virginia’s constitution and conceived and wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, a model for our cherished First Amendment. After serving as the first Secretary of State, and then Vice President, he was elected to the presidency. He ordered American warriors to crush Barbary pirates. He doubled the size of our nation with the Louisiana Purchase and he sent the famous explorers Lewis and Clark into the west on a daring expedition to the Pacific Ocean. He was an architect, an inventor, a diplomat, a scholar, the founder of one of the world’s great universities and an ardent defender of liberty. Americans will forever admire the author of American freedom, Thomas Jefferson, and he too will never, ever be abandoned by us.
Donald Trump: (20:50)
Abraham Lincoln, the savior of our union, was a self-taught country lawyer who grew up in a log cabin on the American frontier. The first Republican president, he rose to high office from obscurity based on a force and clarity of his anti-slavery convictions. Very, very strong convictions. He signed the law that built the Trans-Continental Railroad. He signed the Homestead Act given to some incredible scholars as simply defined ordinary citizens free land to settle anywhere in the American West, and he led the country through the darkest hours of American history, giving every ounce of strength that he had to ensure that government of the people, by the people and for the people did not perish from this earth. He served as commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces during our bloodiest war, the struggle that saved our union and extinguished the evil of slavery. Over 600,000 died in that war, more than 20, 000 were killed or wounded in a single day in Antietam. At Gettysburg 157 years ago, the Union bravely withstood an assault of nearly 15,000 men and threw back Pickett’s Charge. Lincoln won the Civil War. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He led the passage of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery for all-time and ultimately his determination to preserve our nation and our union cost him his life. For as long as we live, Americans will uphold and revere the immortal memory of President Abraham Lincoln.
Donald Trump: (23:46)
Theodore Roosevelt exemplified the unbridled confidence of our national culture and identity. He saw the towering grandeur of America’s mission in the world and he pursued it with overwhelming energy and zeal. As a Lieutenant Colonel during the Spanish-American War, he led the famous Rough Riders to defeat the enemy at San Juan Hill. He cleaned up corruption as police commissioner of New York City, then served as the Governor of New York, Vice President, and at 42 years old, became the youngest ever President of the United States.
Donald Trump: (24:43)
He sent our great new naval fleet around the globe to announce America’s arrival as a world power. He gave us many of our national parks, including the Grand Canyon. He oversaw the construction of the awe-inspiring Panama Canal and he is the only person ever awarded both the Nobel Peace Prize and the Congressional Medal of Honor. He was American freedom personified in full. The American people will never relinquish the bold, beautiful and untamed spirit of Theodore Roosevelt.
Donald Trump: (25:39)
No movement that seeks to dismantle these treasured American legacies can possibly have a love of America at its heart. Can’t happen. No person who remains quiet at the destruction of this resplendent heritage can possibly lead us to a better future. The radical ideology attacking our country advances under the banner of social justice, but in truth, it would demolish both justice and society. It would transform justice into an instrument of division and vengeance and it would turn our free and inclusive society into a place of a repression, domination, and exclusion. They want to silence us, but we will not be silenced.
Crowd: (26:43)
USA! USA! USA! USA!
Crowd: (26:43)
We love you!
Crowd: (26:43)
We love you President Trump.
Donald Trump: (27:11)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (27:17)
We will state the truth in full without apology. We declare that the United States of America is the most just and exceptional nation ever to exist on earth. We are proud of the fact that our country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles and we understand that these values have dramatically advanced the cause of peace and justice throughout the world. We know that the American family is the bedrock of American life. We recognize the solemn right and moral duty of every nation to secure its borders and we are building the wall. We remember that governments exist to protect the safety and happiness of their own people. A nation must care for its own citizens first. We must take care of America first. It’s time. We believe in equal opportunity, equal justice, and equal treatment for citizens of every race, background, religion and creed. Every child of every color, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of God.
Donald Trump: (29:26)
We want free and open debate, not speech codes and cancel culture. We embrace tolerance, not prejudice. We support the courageous men and women of law enforcement. We will never abolish our police or our great Second Amendment which gives us the right to keep and bear arms. We believe that our children should be taught to love their country, honor their history, and respect our great American flag. We stand tall, we stand proud, and we only kneel to Almighty God. This is who we are. This is what we believe and these are the values that will guide us as we strive to build an even better and greater future. Those who seek to erase our heritage want Americans to forget our pride and our great dignity so that we can no longer understand ourselves or America’s destiny. In toppling the heroes of 1776, they seek to dissolve the bonds of love and loyalty that we feel for our country and that we feel for each other. Their goal is not a better America, their goal is to end America.
Donald Trump: (31:25)
In its place, they want power for themselves, but just as patriots did in centuries past, the American people will stand in their way and we will win and win quickly and with great dignity. We will never let them rip America’s heroes from our monuments or from our hearts. By tearing down Washington and Jefferson, these radicals would tear down the very heritage for which men gave their lives to win the Civil War, they would erase the memory that inspired those soldiers to go to their deaths, singing these words of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, “As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, while God is marching on.” They would tear down the principles that propelled the abolition of slavery and ultimately around the world ending an evil institution that had plagued humanity for thousands and thousands of years. Our opponents would tear apart the very documents that Martin Luther King used to express his dream and the ideas that were the foundation of the righteous movement for Civil Rights. They would tear down the beliefs, culture and identity, that have made America the most vibrant and tolerant society in the history of the earth. My fellow Americans, it is time to speak up loudly and strongly and powerfully and defend the integrity of our country.

USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Donald Trump: (34:03)
It is time for our politicians to summon the bravery and determination of our American ancestors. It is time. It is time to plant our flag and to protect the greatest of this nation for citizens of every race in every city in every part of this glorious land. For the sake of our honor, for the sake of our children, for the sake of our union, we must protect and preserve our history, our heritage, and our great heroes. Here tonight before the eyes of our forefathers, Americans declare again, as we did 244 years ago, that we will not be tyrannized, we will not be demeaned, and we will not be intimidated by bad, evil people. It will not happen.
Crowd: (35:12)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
Donald Trump: (35:32)
We will proclaim the ideals of the Declaration of Independence and we will never surrender the spirit and the courage and the cause of July 4, 1776. Upon this ground, we will stand firm and unwavering. In the face of lies meant to divide us, demoralize us and diminish us, we will show that the story of America unites us and –
Donald Trump: (36:03)
We will show that the story of America unites us, inspires us, includes us all, and makes everyone free. We must demand that our children are taught once again to see America as did Reverend Martin Luther King when he said that the founders had signed a promissory note to every future generation. Dr. King saw that the mission of justice required us to fully embrace our founding ideals. Those ideals are so important to us, the founding ideals.
Donald Trump: (36:43)
He called on his fellow citizens not to rip down their heritage, but to live up to their heritage. Above all, our children from every community must be taught that to be American is to inherit the spirit of the most adventurous and confident people ever to walk the face of the Earth. Americans are the people who pursued our Manifest Destiny across the ocean, into the uncharted wilderness, over the tallest mountains, and then into the skies, and even into the stars.
Donald Trump: (37:33)
We are the country of Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant, and Frederick Douglas. We are the land of Wild Bill Hickock and Buffalo Bill Cody. We are the nation that gave rise to the Wright brothers, the Tuskegee airmen, Harriet Tubman, Clara Barton, Jesse Owens, George Patton, General George Patton, the great Louis Armstrong, Alan Shepard, Elvis Presley, and Muhammad Ali, and only America could have produced them all. No other place.
Donald Trump: (38:26)
We are the culture that put up the Hoover Dam, laid down the highways, and sculpted the skyline of Manhattan. We are the people who dreamed the spectacular dream, it was called Las Vegas in the Nevada desert, who built up Miami from the Florida marsh, and who carved our heroes into the face of Mount Rushmore. Americans harnessed electricity, split the atom, and gave the world the telephone and the internet. We settled the Wild West, won two World Wars, landed American astronauts on the moon.
Donald Trump: (39:25)
And one day very soon, we will plant our flag on Mars. We gave the world the poetry of Walt Whitman, the stories of Mark Twain, the songs of Irving Berlin, the voice of Ella Fitzgerald, the style of Frank Sinatra, the comedy of Bob Hope, the power of the Saturn V rocket, the toughness of the Ford F150, and the awesome might of the American aircraft carriers.
Donald Trump: (40:23)
Americans must never lose sight of this miraculous story. We should never lose sight of it. Nobody has ever done it like we have done it. So today, under the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I am announcing the creation of a new monument to the giants of our past. I am signing an executive order to establish the National Guard of American heroes, a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans to ever live.
Donald Trump: (41:24)
From this night, and from this magnificent place, let us go forward united in our purpose and rededicated in our resolve. We will raise the next generation of American patriots. We will write the next thrilling chapter of the American adventure. And we will teach our children to know that they live in a land of legends, that nothing can stop them, and that no one can hold them down. They will know that, in America, you can do anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything.
Donald Trump: (42:23)
Uplifted by the titans of Mount Rushmore, we will find unity that no one expected. We will make strides that no one thought possible. This country will be everything that our citizens have hoped for for so many years, and that our enemies fear, because we will never forget that the American freedom exists for American greatness. And that’s what we have, American greatness. Centuries from now, our legacy will be the cities we built, the champions we forged, the good that we did, and the monuments we created to inspire us all. My fellow citizens, America’s destiny is in our sights. America’s heroes are embedded in our hearts. America’s future is in our hands. And ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come. This has been a great honor for the First Lady and myself to be with you. I love your state. I love this country. I’d like to wish everybody a very happy Fourth of July to all. God bless you. God bless your families. God bless our great military, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Jul 2, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Very nice. Thank you. Big day. My pleasure to welcome you all to the beautiful, great White House and to host this magnificent showcase of America’s incredible small businesses. I just got to witness some beautiful product. Today we received outstanding news from all over our country, really. The United States economy has added almost 5 million new jobs in the month of June. That’s shattering all expectations and shattering all records, historic records. History of our country we’ve never edited anywhere near that. And last month we also broke the record, but now we shattered it much higher than even last month. This is the largest monthly jobs gain in history. We added 2.1 million leisure and hospitality jobs, 740,000 retail jobs, 568,000 education jobs and health care jobs, 357,000 service jobs. And very importantly to me, because you know what’s happening with manufacturing. We’re bringing it back because we’ve made incredible trade deals.
Donald Trump: (01:14)
So manufacturing jobs are coming back and we added 356,000 manufacturing jobs. Incredible, incredible numbers, all records. African American workers made historic gains the likes of which we’ve never had before with 404,000 new jobs in June. That’s a record and that’s the highest number ever. We had 700,000 new jobs over the last two months for African American workers. That’s the highest ever. And both months are the highest. We shattered last month’s record. That was a record and we shattered it. Hispanic employment is up by 1.5 million jobs, great businessmen and women and they’re up 1.5, think of it, million jobs, Hispanic. 80% of small businesses are now open. New business applications have doubled since late March. America’s economy is coming back much stronger than ever anticipated by most people, almost all people because these numbers were… even the most optimistic people, these numbers are being doubled and tripled over what they thought would be possible.
Donald Trump: (02:31)
We’re grateful to be joined today by Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. Thank you very much, Wilbur. Thank you very much. You’re doing a great job. Every company here today embodies true American excellence. Your stunning craftsmanship, I just witnessed some of it. It’s incredible. It’s treasured and prized all over the world. The product you make is like none other and your spirit for America and the greatness of our country is unrivaled. With us are workers who make decorative American flags from Virginia, fly fishing reels from Florida, grills from Illinois, pies from North Carolina, looked very good to me. Coffee from Oklahoma, ice cream from Maryland and sunscreen and baseball bats from Texas, with unmatched skill and devotion you make the goods and build the products that proudly bear the wonderful phrase made in the USA. You seeing that more and more, made in the USA. We’re bringing our jobs back because of trade deals.
Donald Trump: (03:38)
We have great trade deals and jobs are coming back and we have a lot of great trade deals right now under negotiation. We got to get them done as quickly as possible. The small businesses represented in this room continue a great and noble American heritage. You’re entrepreneurs, artisans, creators, craftsmen who forged your own path, made your own products and provide good paying jobs for our citizens, credible jobs, incredible people, and they truly are artisans. And you’re doing it all with American hands, American heart and American pride. Several of these companies are entirely veteran owned and operated. Especially as we approach Independence Day, I want to thank the courageous men and women who have served their country in uniform. We vowed to honor your sacrifice by forever defending the rights, freedoms, and principles you risked your entire life to defend.
Donald Trump: (04:46)
Following the arrival of the plague from China, that’s what it is. It’s a plague and it should have never happened. China should have never let that happen, but China did allow it to happen. We had just signed a brand new trade deal and the ink wasn’t even dry when this came over, but we raced into action to save our nation’s small businesses. We passed over 3 trillion in historic relief measures, $3 trillion think of that, including over $670 billion for the paycheck protection program, a tremendous success as you can see by the numbers, to keep small business workers on the payroll. I signed a bill providing federally funded paid sick leave and paid family leave for American workers, things that have never been done. We’re allowing businesses to defer paying their income tax and we expanded tax refunds very substantially thanks to our efforts and the incredible resilience of our nation’s small businesses. And I really think we can add the foundation that we built.
Donald Trump: (05:55)
We built the greatest economy ever built, and that foundation was so strong that instead of coming weekly back or going in the other direction, because this is coming back and we haven’t totally succeeded yet, we will soon, but we haven’t killed all of the virus yet. And yet you look at these numbers and that’s based on a very strong foundation that we built. A foundation like no other, a foundation that had we not been attacked by this virus, this horrible virus, we were doing things and had things planned that nobody else had ever even thought of. Paying off debt, building numbers the likes of which nobody’s seen. And yet next year we’ll be in a position where I believe in a certain respect, I think we’ll even be stronger than we would have been because of what we’re doing. But only that strong foundation allowed us to be up here today talking about these records, setting job numbers and other numbers that we’re producing.
Donald Trump: (07:00)
Because America’s economy is now roaring back to life like nobody’s ever seen before nobody’s ever seen numbers like this. In May retail sales surge by nearly 18%, that’s a record. We recently saw the best 50 day increase in the history of the stock market. So we had 50 days, go back a couple of weeks. We had 50 days the likes of which we’ve never had in the history of the stock market, which to me means jobs. And it’s lifting up 401Ks and retirement savings for American workers. We’re doing numbers like nobody’s ever seen before, take a look at 401Ks. In a pandemic, we’re almost even with where we were before the pandemic started and nobody would have said that was possible, nobody at all. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world and we’re now doing it again.
Donald Trump: (07:56)
And I think we’ll do even better the second time than we did the first time, unless somebody comes along and says, let’s raise taxes on everybody. And they’re raising taxes, not only on cooperations, they’ll just go to another country and they’ll do just fine. But they’re raising taxes on people and middle income people and they’re losing jobs. So you can’t allow that to happen. All of this incredible job that we’ve done will go down like that. It will be a terrible, terrible sight. It might be even be a 1929 situation. So you have a chance to have the greatest numbers in history, you’re almost there. We’re almost back to where we were from the standpoint of the stock market, think of that. But you’ll have a crash like you’ve never seen before. If you put the wrong person in office, you’ll see things that you would not have believed are possible.
Donald Trump: (08:51)
They want to raise taxes, they want to raise regulations. Big part of what we’ve done is by cutting regulation. We’ve cut regulation more than any president in the history of our country, whether they’re there for four years, eight years, or in one case, more than that, nobody even came close. And we’re doing much more. We have regulation, but it’s proper regulation, not strangulation. We’re also tapping into the talent genius and the drive of our people to kill the virus. We’re speeding the delivery of new treatments, including antiviral, steroids, convalescent, plasma, and other therapies. We have therapeutics that are really, really looking good. And this includes two drugs that have proven effective, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone which is having a tremendous trial. And we’ll see how that all happens. But we have three vaccine candidates. We’ve had many more, but three are really, really looking good.
Donald Trump: (09:56)
And I think you’re going to have an answer to that very soon. Three vaccine candidates are now in trial with three more to start very shortly. These are all great companies. They’ve had tremendous success with other problems in the past, and we’re accelerating production through Operation Warp Speed. Plus, we have our military ready. So should we get whether it’s therapeutic or vaccine, our military is ready, logistically ready. These are the best in the world to get it out to everybody as soon as we have it and we think we’re going to have it soon. As we prepare to celebrate the 4th of July, let us renew our devotion to this nation, to its citizens and the eternal values that define our past and shape our future. I’m going to Mount Rushmore on July 3rd. We’re going to have a tremendous evening. It’s going to be a fireworks display like few people have seen.
Donald Trump: (10:53)
It’s going to be very exciting. It’s going to be beautiful. They’ve been wanting to do that for years, fireworks. They used to do it many years ago and for some reason they were unable or unallowable to do it. They just weren’t allowed to do it. And I opened it up and we’re going to have a tremendous July 3rd and then we’re coming back here celebrating the 4th of July in Washington, DC. And I want to also thank all of law enforcement. The job you’ve done is incredible. We signed a bill, you play with our monuments or our statues, you go to jail for 10 years. It’s amazing how it all stopped so fast, stopped so fast. We let the local authorities handle it as long as possible, but ultimately we said, let’s step in. And we stepped in and it stopped. 10 years in jail if they do what they were doing.
Donald Trump: (11:42)
So we’re very proud of law enforcement. We want to thank law enforcement, really great job. Our military has been incredible. Our National Guard has been just incredible all over. I’m glad to see in Seattle, they took care of the problem because as they know, we were going in to take, we were ready to go in and they knew that too and they went in and they did what they had to do. We’re a nation committed to equal and abundant opportunity for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. The American dream is the sacred birthright of every American child. And that’s what we have, is we have the American dream. And nobody’s going to shatter the American dream, not the anarchists, not the agitators, not the fools, not the looters. They’re not going to have any impact on the national dream, the national dream like no other.
Donald Trump: (12:34)
That’s why we’re here today to ensure that every citizen can achieve their dream, achieve their destiny and realize their full and extraordinary potential. That is how we will renew, rebuild and restore America. We’ve done an incredible job in a three and a half year period, a job like nobody thought would be possible to be done, and we’re doing it again. And we’re doing it, I believe, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. You’re going to see that next year. And unless it’s tampered with, we’re going to have a year next year like no other. It’ll be a phenomenal year, a successful year and we’ll have our best job numbers ever next year.
Donald Trump: (13:19)
We’ll come back stronger and more prosperous than ever before and next year will be, I think it’ll be one of the, from an economic standpoint, the greatest or one of the greatest economic years we’ve ever had. So I just want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank all of these incredible artisans and business people for showcasing your amazing products. And I just want to leave you by saying very important words, God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Jul 2, 2020","Donald Trump: (10:04)
Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. This is mostly an economic conference and we have Steven Mnuchin with us, Larry Kudlow. I’d like to just announce the spectacular news for American workers and American families and for our country as a whole. There’s not been anything like this at record setting. It was just put out that the United States economy added almost five million jobs in the month of June, shattering all expectations. I was watching this morning and the expectations were much lower than that. The stock market is doing extremely well, which means to me jobs. That’s what it means, jobs. This is the largest monthly jobs gain in the history of our country.
Donald Trump: (10:55)
The unemployment rate fell by more than two percentage points down to just about 11%. We’re down to the 11% number. We started at a number very much higher than that. As you know, we broke the record last month and we broke it again this month and in an even bigger way. This news comes on top of May’s extraordinary jobs report, which was revised upwards, by the way, to 2.7 million jobs. It was 2.5. That was last month, and that was a record setter. But it actually got a little bit better. We revised it. It was revised upward to 2.7 million jobs for a combined total of 7.5 million jobs created in the last two months. And that’s a record by many millions of jobs. So it’s 7.5 million jobs created in the last two months alone. Today’s announcement proves that our economy is roaring back. It’s coming back extremely strong. We have some areas where we’re putting out the flames of the fires and that’s working out well. We’re working very closely with governors and I think it’s working out very well. I think you’ll see that shortly.
Donald Trump: (12:07)
In June, we added 2.1 million leisure and hospitality jobs, 740,000 retail jobs, 568,000 education and healthcare jobs, 357,000 service jobs. These are all historic numbers. And 356,000 manufacturing jobs. And manufacturing looks like it’s ready to really take off at a level that it’s never been before. And a lot of that has to do with our trade policy because we’re bringing manufacturing back to our country and these take a long time to get going, and they’re now going. So these are historic numbers. I’m really happy when I see 356,000 manufacturing jobs. And that’s just a small number compared to what it will be soon because of our great trade deals.
Donald Trump: (12:56)
African American workers, really happily for me, made historic gains with 404,000 jobs added last month alone. And that’s a record. And the second largest jump will be last month. And what we have, if you add the two months together, it’s 700,000 jobs for African American workers. Add in to the last two months, and that’s a record by a lot. Likewise, Hispanic employment is up by 1.5 million jobs, a record by a lot. Hispanic employment up 1.5 million jobs. Three million more women were employed in the month of June. A record. Never had a number like that. Workers with a high school education or less made the biggest strides of all. So people that have just a high school education or have less than a high school education, with unemployment, those without a high school diploma drop a full 3.3 percentage points. That’s the largest drop in recorded history. 80% of small businesses are now open. 80%. And we think we’re going to have some very good numbers in the coming months because others are opening, especially as we put the flame out, getting rid of the flame, it’s happening.
Donald Trump: (14:26)
New business applications have doubled since late March. That’s a number that is not even thinkable to achieve this early into a pandemic. The latest ISM manufacturing report rose 25 percentage points, with new orders jumping a remarkable 25 percentage points, all a record. Consumer confidence, which is great. That’s a great number to me because that means confidence is really good. If you don’t have good consumer confidence, it’s like life, if you don’t have confidence you’re not going to do very well. Consumer confidence has risen 12 points since April. At six months, job expectations hit an all-time high. So think of that for a second. With all we go through, with all of the trials and tribulations that we read about every night, much of it totally fake news, fortunately, and if the consumer didn’t get it, you wouldn’t have good consumer confidence. We have consumer confidence has arisen 12 points since April. An all-time high. Think of that.
Donald Trump: (15:42)
Retail sales surge an astonishing 18%. So retail sales went up an astonishing 18% in May. That’s the largest increase in the history of our country. That’s a tremendous number, 18%. And what it means to me is jobs. The number of unemployed Americans reentering the labor force rose by 43%. And fewer workers are dropping out of the labor force than before. And the crisis is being handled.
Donald Trump: (16:19)
If you look, we were talking this morning, something to think about. China was way early, and they’re getting under control just now. And Europe was way early, and they’re getting under control. We followed them with this terrible China virus. And we are likewise getting under control. Some areas that were very hard hit are now doing very well. Some were doing very well and we thought they may be gone and they flare up and we’re putting out the fires. But other places were long before us, and they’re now… It’s a life. It’s got a life. And we’re putting out that life because that’s a bad life that we’re talking about.
Donald Trump: (17:07)
All of this, suggested workers are confident about finding a new job. The stock market is soaring with the best gains in over 20 years. In the second quarter, the Dow Jones increased 18%. This is in a quarter. These are not numbers that people have heard about. It’s the best in 33 years. The S&P 500 increased by almost 20%. The best since 1998 for the quarter. And Nasdaq increased over 30%. The best since 1999. And we had a 15 month, if you look over a long period of time, a phenomenal number. But if you look since the election, we’ve gone up. The Dow went up close to 45%. The S&P 500 went up 47%. And Nasdaq Composite went up getting close to 100%. So these are numbers that are not numbers that other presidents would have, and they won’t have it. The only thing they can kill, it’s a bad president or a president that wants to raise taxes. If you want to raise taxes, this whole thing, your 401ks will drop down to nothing and your stock market will drop down to nothing. This is not just luck what’s happening, this is a lot of talent.
Donald Trump: (18:36)
All of this incredible news is the result of historic actions my administration has taken working with our partners in Congress to rescue the US economy from a horrible event that was formed, took place in China, and came here, and they could have stopped it. They could have stopped it. Nobody likes to write that, but they could have stopped it. They know it and I know it.
Donald Trump: (19:03)
Through the paycheck protection program, we’ve extended over $520 billion in loans to nearly 5 million small businesses, saving and supporting the jobs of tens of millions of American workers. This has been a tremendous success. Levels that nobody’s ever seen before. But we saved all of those jobs and all of those small businesses, and some will be large businesses soon, perhaps. We also rushed urgently needed relief to millions and millions of hardworking taxpayers. They got that directly and we’re working on a phase four. We’re working with Congress. That work has started. Steve Mnuchin can give you a little briefing. Talking about payroll tax cuts, we’re talking about more money being infused. And it comes back to us. It comes back. It’s all coming back. It’s coming back faster, bigger, and better than we ever thought possible. These are the numbers. These are not numbers made up by me, these are numbers.
Donald Trump: (20:02)
These are not numbers made up by me. These are numbers. We’ve implemented an aggressive strategy to vanquish and kill the virus, and protect Americans at the highest risk, while allowing those at lower risk to return safely to work. That’s what’s happening. Our health experts continue to address the temporary hotspots in certain cities and counties, and we’re working very hard on that, where the relationship with the governors is very good. We made a call, Mike Pence made a call just yesterday, and said, “What do you need?” Not one governor needed anything. They don’t need anything. They have all the medical equipment they can have. “Thank you, US government.”
Donald Trump: (20:45)
All of the ventilators they have, we’re giving many ventilators, and selling in some cases, and giving when needed, but we’re the ventilator king. We’re now producing thousands of ventilators, thousands of ventilators a week, and we’re helping other countries, and other countries are desperately in need of ventilators. Because this is now at 189 countries. That changes all the time, that number. Our last count is 189 countries, and many of them don’t have money, and almost all of them don’t have a capacity to build a ventilator, which is hard to build, very complex, very expensive. Very big, in many cases. We’ve done an incredible job. So we have assembly lines building ventilators, and we’re building thousands a week.
Donald Trump: (21:36)
All of these people are working with governors and local officials to restore best practices, and that’s what we’ve done. That includes face covering, social distancing, testing, and personal hygiene. Wash your hands. State officials will decide how rapidly to open their economies. That’s largely up to them. If we see something that’s egregious, we’ve gotten involved with a couple of them where we thought it was unfair. We’d like to see churches opened quickly, and some of them just don’t want to do that. In New York, we got a great ruling from a judge, thank you, Judge, that they can open.
Donald Trump: (22:11)
If these best practices are implemented, then the hotspots can be calmed quickly, and we understand this horrible disease right now. We didn’t understand the disease at all. We did the right thing. We closed it up. We would have lost millions of lives. We’ve done a historic thing. We would have lost millions of lives, and now we’re opening it up, and it’s opening up far faster than anybody thought even possible, and more successfully.
Donald Trump: (22:37)
And as I said, you’re going to have a fantastic third quarter. It’ll be a third quarter the likes of which nobody has ever seen before, in my opinion. And the good thing is the numbers will be coming out just prior to the election, so people will be able to see those numbers. The fourth quarter, likewise, will be extremely good. And maybe most importantly, from the standpoint of our country itself, next year will be a historic year. Next year is going to be an incredible year for jobs, for companies, for growth. Things are happening like nobody would have thought possible.
Donald Trump: (23:10)
I do want to comment, Boeing, as you know, is moving along in their process. It’s been a very hard process, a very complicated process. But they have made tremendous, tremendous gains, and they’re going for approvals on the aircraft, the 737 Max. They’re also starting to do some real business. So I just want to congratulate Boeing. They’ve been through so much. I think it was probably the greatest company in the world. I used to say it was the greatest company in the world, and then it ran through a very tough period of time, but I just want to say that Boeing has made tremendous progress in a short period of time. And other companies, I don’t even have to talk about, because they’re all setting records, every one. Virtually every one of our great companies is setting records.
Donald Trump: (23:58)
So I want to thank everybody for being here today. These are historic numbers in a time that a lot of people would have wilted. They would have wilted, but we didn’t wilt and our country didn’t wilt, and I’m very honored to be your president. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Speaker 4: (24:16)
[crosstalk 00:24:16] Russian bounties in your PDB?
Steve Mnuchin: (24:25)
So let me just make some additional comments. And first of all, we couldn’t be more pleased with the results today. Again, between this month and last month, that’s about eight million jobs, eight million people we put back to work because of the CARES Act and working with Congress. I think, as you know, people thought we would have 30 million people unemployed. Fortunately, we never got to that. So eight million jobs back, but our work is not done. Our work won’t be done until every single American who lost their job because of COVID gets back to work. And there’s no question, I want to thank the Senate and the House for working with us. There’s no question these programs are working. I also want to thank them for extending the PPP.
Steve Mnuchin: (25:09)
As I’ve said, it’s our priority, when we get to the CARES 4 bill in July, we will look to work with the House and Senate on a bipartisan basis to repurpose that money. We have about $130 billion left. There are going to be a number of businesses that are particularly hard hit, and we’ll be looking to give those businesses additional money. So CARES 4 will be much more targeted for the businesses that continue to need work, but there is no question that this is working, and we look forward to continuing this progress. Again, I think eight million jobs, really extraordinary.
Steve Mnuchin: (25:47)
Now, let me just make one other comment. Director Kudlow and I are not wearing masks up here because we’ve both been tested this morning, and that’s the only reason. But even with that, we did social distance, so I’m pleased to see you’re all wearing masks. I’m going to let Director Kudlow make a few comments, and then we’ll both be happy to take questions.
Director Kudlow: (26:05)
Thanks, Steven. Just briefly underscoring these high frequency indicators, it’s a difficult thing to do. We haven’t had much experience with these pandemics, but I will say this. The Apple Mobility Index is a very important index. It’s literally a realtime daily indicator, and we’re not seeing any declines. It’s still strengthening. Even, I might add, in some of the Southwestern states, which have difficult hotspots. Housing demand and housing surveys are just soaring. Automobile demand now expected for the third quarter, about 10 million plus production units. The trucking surveys look very, very strong.
Director Kudlow: (26:48)
And the Dallas Fed survey, I don’t recall if it was in the President’s notes, because it’s obviously in Texas, a bad hotspot. The Dallas Fed survey, which goes to the end of the month, has not yet shown any declines. Now, it may. I’m not going to rule that out, and I would say as a general matter, these job numbers, as good as they are, erasing a third to a half of those who are unemployed, there’s still a lot of hardship and a lot of heartbreak in these numbers. I understand that. And the economy’s on its way back. We have a ways to go.
Director Kudlow: (27:21)
I will, however, continue to reference the Congressional Budget Office, which is looking for a very strong third quarter and second half, and a number of private surveys and private forecasters who see the same story on the V-shape recovery, and with good policies and leadership, 2021 can be a big bang year, and we will be able to get back to the peak levels of 2019. So I believe we’re well positioned. I think we have a lot more work to do. I get that, and as Steven mentioned, we’ll see how the policy discussions go later this month. Thanks.
Steve Mnuchin: (27:58)
Sure. Go ahead.
Speaker 5: (27:59)
Mr. Secretary, are you concerned to see new unemployment claims rising? We’re at 1.4 million layoffs last week, and that number is actually going up, not going down. Are you concerned about that?
Steve Mnuchin: (28:11)
Well, let me just say again. I want to just say, we’re going to be concerned till every single person is back to work. Now, when you look at these numbers, I think it’s tough enough to predict economic numbers in normal times. In these times, you have to look at all these numbers in their entirety. So what I would say on that is, there’s a lag on the unemployment claims. I think you also know many of these states, we said upfront, are completely backed up. So no, I would focus on … The jobs numbers are the most accurate numbers. The trend of eight million jobs back. But having said that, I’m concerned until we get everybody back to work.
Speaker 6: (28:50)
Obviously this is good news today. No question about it. But it’s also obvious that the crisis that is surging through Sun Belt states, record number of cases nationally yesterday, threatens all of these economic gains. Many states are throwing their reopenings into reverse. What additional actions is the administration going to take to stop that? Will the administration, and will the president specifically call on Americans to wear masks? And why don’t we have, rather than you guys celebrating good news that’s already happened, why don’t we have the Coronavirus Task Force up here, giving briefings on how to get under control what is obviously not under control, as Anthony Fauci said this week?
Steve Mnuchin: (29:38)
Well, let me just say, I am on the Coronavirus Task Force, so I’m happy to answer a few of those questions. I can’t comment on the schedule of briefings. I’m not aware of that. The President specifically put in his speech encouraging Americans to wear masks, social distance, and hygiene. Because he’s the President of the United States, and people are not around him close, and the people who are around are tested, I don’t think he needs to wear a mask, but the rest-
Steve Mnuchin: (30:03)
Who are around are tested. I don’t think he needs to wear a mask, but the rest of us, absolutely. And the President supports wearing mask. I was at the House this week testifying. I’m sure you saw my picture with Chair Powell on the Wall Street Journal. I never thought we’d have a picture like that, but yes, we are encouraging Americans to wear masks. Now, unlike last time, as I’ve said, and yes, I realize the numbers of cases, we’re monitoring that carefully, we’re monitoring the hospital capacity. Let me just say, I’ve been briefed on where we are on vaccines and virals. I’m very encouraged we’ll have things by the end of the year. So yes, we’re going to be careful. And I wouldn’t say reverse. I would say the states appropriately are pausing certain things like bars and gyms, which obviously are the more contagious types of things.
Steve Mnuchin: (30:47)
And I think the states are acting appropriately. Yes.
Speaker 7: (30:49)
[inaudible 00:00:30:50].
Director Kudlow: (30:51)
[inaudible 00:00:52]. Look, Debra Berks has been down in Arizona and Texas, so they have put a team in play and CDC is doing more of that. And what they’re doing is working with local officials, government officials, but health officials to really reemphasize what I call the list of best practices. And I think that will do the trick. And if you have to phase out, as Steven said, phase out bars, so be it for a few weeks. I think some places might’ve been overexuberant and now have to come back and get back to these best practices of distancing and masks and testing and personal hygiene.
Speaker 7: (31:38)
[inaudible 00:31:38] the President just said a few minutes ago that we’re getting this under control. It is obvious to anyone watching that it is not under control and Anthony Fauci said so out loud this week.
Steve Mnuchin: (31:48)
I think what Dr. Fauci said is that if people don’t take these things seriously.
Director Kudlow: (31:54)
Yeah.
Steve Mnuchin: (31:54)
Okay, that the numbers could continue to spike. So-
Speaker 7: (31:58)
They’re spiking right now.
Steve Mnuchin: (32:00)
Again, what I’d say is the numbers are up. We’re obviously watching this very carefully. We think that there is the right balance and we’re working with the states on the health issues and the economic issues. We’ll go to the next question. Yes.
Speaker 8: (32:12)
Mr. Secretary, there is a record number of new infections every day, just the White House regrets encouraging states to open as quickly as it did. And do you think some of that has backfired?
Steve Mnuchin: (32:22)
No, absolutely not. I think we’ve had a very careful plan, again, working with the states. This is primarily the state’s responsibility, but working with the states. And again, I think there’s plenty of places. We can get people back to work safely. I can tell you in the treasury, we’re going to take more people back, we are social distancing, we’re checking people’s temperature at times, there is a safe way to reopen the economy and we’re going to do that carefully. Yes.
Speaker 9: (32:50)
What lesson are you [crosstalk 00:32:52].
Speaker 10: (32:50)
Secretary, a lot of Americans worry about what’s going to happen with schools in the fall for kids. And there’s a real economic argument that without schools a of the workforce, can’t actually truly return to work. What is the administration doing about this? How are you working on it? Are there strategies that you’re trying to employ?
Steve Mnuchin: (33:07)
We’re working with schools and universities. Again, I think in most cases, schools will be able to open safely. Some schools will need to spend money. One of the things we’ll look at in CARES 4 is if we need to give money to schools, to properly equip their areas. I think that’s something that will be high.
Speaker 10: (33:29)
[inaudible 00:00:33:28].
Steve Mnuchin: (33:29)
Absolutely, we want to make sure that kids are safe and that if there is money that schools need to spend to safely have people in classrooms, social distance, spread things out, change hours, these are all the things we’re looking at.
Speaker 11: (33:43)
Mr. Secretary, can you assess the current need for American families in a phase four bill? In the spring you said that a very big number was needed. What’s the current need?
Steve Mnuchin: (33:52)
I think it’s too early to tell. And that’s the reason why we’re waiting. We spent an unprecedented amount of money. We have authorization of $3 trillion. That’s an extraordinary amount of money. A lot of that money is not in the economy yet. We’re continuing. That’s why we’re extending things like the PPP. And before we go back to Congress and I’m already having conversations with certain members of Democrats and Republicans to get ideas, but we want to see the economic numbers. As I said earlier, people thought we were going to have 30 million people unemployed right now. Fortunately we’re about 15 million unemployed. We had 5 million people unemployed before this. So we got 10 million people to put back to work. The President’s committed to do what we need to do in the next bill to protect kids, protect jobs, protect liability. Yes, in the back.
Speaker 12: (34:42)
Mr. Secretary, if you take a look at the President’s Twitter feed over the past few days, he tweeted a video of a supporter yelling, “White power,” he’s been tweeting a veto threat If the military bases are named away from Confederate Generals, he’s been tweeting a lot about Confederate statues and not wanting them to come down. We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Is the President more focused on preserving or celebrating the Confederacy than getting this pandemic under control?
Steve Mnuchin: (35:09)
Let me just say, I think the President’s focused on everything. I think this issue of statues and everything else is a complicated issue. There was an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal from the Cardinal in New York about the Bible and everybody other than Mary and Jesus Christ, I think it’s a very complicated issue. We need to have a balanced view of history.
Speaker 12: (35:32)
Can I ask about the white power video because he [inaudible 00:05:33].
Steve Mnuchin: (35:35)
[inaudible 00:35:35] we’re here to talk about economics. We’ll take one more question in the back.
Speaker 13: (35:39)
Mr. Secretary.
Speaker 14: (35:39)
Mr. Secretary.
Steve Mnuchin: (35:39)
In the back, yes.
Speaker 15: (35:39)
Mr. Secretary, where is the Treasury Department on sending stimulus check who mixed status families? There is a lawsuit that was allowed to proceed. Are you guys going to be doing that anytime soon? Or you’re going to leave it to the courts to decide whether the treasury department has to do it?
Steve Mnuchin: (35:55)
I’m sorry. I didn’t understand the question. Was the question on stimulus checks?
Speaker 15: (35:59)
[inaudible 00:35:59] mixed status family. So parents of American citizen children, people who are married to undocumented-
Steve Mnuchin: (36:08)
Our position is that legal Americans, American citizens should get the payments. That’s our focus. If people are here illegally, they’re not going to get economic payments. So-
Speaker 15: (36:22)
Even if they have-
Steve Mnuchin: (36:22)
But let me just say, we’re very focused on as part of the next CARES Act, we’re going to seriously consider whether we need to put more payments and direct payments, over worked very well. Thank you everybody.
Speaker 16: (36:34)
How much state and local aid? How much aid for state and local governments?
Steve Mnuchin: (36:37)
We’ll consider that, [inaudible 00:36:38] discussions."
"Jun 26, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:01)
We’re making a lot of progress with the whole situation that came in from a place called China as you probably know, you probably see, but we have a little work to do and we’ll get it done. We’re having some very good numbers coming out in terms of the comeback, the comeback of our nation and I think it’s going very rapidly and it’s going to be very good but right now we’re in that process of building and it’s an honor that you’re with us today, we very much appreciate it. I’m delighted to welcome members of the Workforce Policy Advisory Board and I want to thank Ivanka she works very hard on this Board. She works very hard to get jobs and it’s made in the USA and jobs in the USA. I saw a group of your people yesterday having to do with ships, you’re involved in that partnership and it’s fantastic what they’re doing in Wisconsin. It was really a great day.
Donald Trump: (01:00)
The Secretary of Treasury is with us and he’s worked very hard and I think he’s got some very good things to say and some pretty big news and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Small Business Administrator who has definitely kept busy, Jovita, where’s Jovita? Jovita? Good. Jovita Carranza. Thanks also to Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds who has done terrifically. Kim? Hi Kim, nice to see you. Thank you very much and Eric Holcomb, governor of Indiana and we always recognize Eric because he’s … How tall are you Eric? [inaudible 00:01:45] pretty tall guy, right? But we have one that’s a little taller. You know where that is, Alaska? You know that, right? You’re doing a great job, we appreciate it as well as the CEOs who have signed our pledge to American workers, Marillyn Hewson, thank you very much of Lockheed-Martin. Sebastian Thrun of Udacity and Ginni Rometty of IBM. I want to thank you all, you’ve been really here from the beginning. Very much from the beginning and we appreciate it very much.
Donald Trump: (02:18)
Together we built the greatest economy in history and literally in the history of the world, the greatest we’ve ever had, the greatest the world has ever seen and now we have to bring it back because we had a close in order to save millions of lives. We added 2.5 million jobs last month which was incredible number, the largest monthly increase in history and more than double the previous record, so we’re bringing it back. We had the greatest ever and we had to close it and now we bring it back and we start off with 2.5 million jobs in one month. I would say that’s pretty good Marillyn, right? That’s the highest ever done and then likewise retail sales surge by nearly 18% last month. That was the biggest jump ever recorded, so that’s great. The stock market has seen you go back a week, one week. So the best 50 days in its history, best 50 day increase in the history of the stock markets. Our pledge to America’s workers has secured commitments to over 16 million job and training opportunities from employers nationwide and some of the employers are with us and they’ve been fantastic.
Donald Trump: (03:32)
I want to thank the American people for doing such an incredible job. They understand what’s happening and they see how fast we’re turning it around. I want to just state that this is Americans of all backgrounds that we’re talking about, to have the chance we want to get them the chance to learn and to build a successful career. We want to train Americans and we want to hire Americans so we’re training American and we’re hiring American. Before the pledge and this is a very big factor, we have a problem that has about 22 different names, but I’ll just call it the plague but before the plague struck, we had the lowest African-American and Hispanic-American, Asian-American unemployment ever. We’ve had the most jobs we’ve ever had, almost 160 million jobs. We’ve never been in a position like that. Women were thriving. Best numbers ever and since my election, more than half of those jobs, more than half, first time that’s ever happened went to women but now we want to get that all back, the African-American group got hit very hard. The Hispanic-American group got hit very hard. Essentially all groups got hit hard but now it’s all coming back.
Donald Trump: (04:54)
To further expand opportunity I’m taking a bold action to reform the federal workforce today. I’ll sign an executive order that directs the federal government to replace outdated and really outdated … It’s called degree-based hiring with skill-based hiring so we want it based on skill. The federal government will no longer be narrowly focused on where you went to school but the skills and the talents that you bring to the job. We want that skill to be there, we want it based on merit, we’ve looked at merit for a long time and we’ve been able to get that done and today’s signing is a very, very important one. I think maybe before I sign I’ll ask Ivanka to say a few words and then we’ll go around a little bit. We’ll pick a few people and then we’ll sign and we go back to work. Thank you very much, Ivanka.
Ivanka Trump: (05:47)
Thank you Mr. President and it’s an honor to have you here. We just convened our sixth meeting of our Workforce Advisory Board and we got an update on the team’s response on your bold call to action. First we’re going to be launching and Ginni Rometty in partnership with Tim Cook spearheaded this group, a massive advertising campaign that directs those that need to re-skill, learn a new trade to secure a job to the resources to enable them to do that so we’re very excited about the launch of this private sector led and driven campaign to match Americans with the training they need and ultimately the job they can seize that exists. The Advisory Board is also creating a series of pilot programs and Scott Pulsipher and Doug McMillon had been running these groups where we really think about how we create the resumes of the future and allow people to find job vacancies based on skill and for employers to connect with those unemployed workers again based on skill so creating a lot more efficiency to that process.
Ivanka Trump: (06:51)
You are once again leading by example here today with this EO signing. As the nation’s largest employer, we are always seeking to recruit and retain the best and the brightest to serve the American people. Last December you fought for and secured paid leave for every federal worker, this was a first, creating a workplace that reflects our American values of both work and family and helping us retain our amazing talent. It’s also why you fought so hard this spring when COVID struck to secure paid sick leave for Americans employed by small businesses and additional funding for child care providers helping millions and millions of Americans remain employed and providing relief to small businesses across the country. This is going to ensure a faster and stronger recovery.
Ivanka Trump: (07:40)
Today, we’re taking that next step as you mentioned and signing an executive order that directs federal agencies to hire based on skills and knowledge, not just outdated degree requirements. This will allow us to better recognize the talents and competencies of all Americans we hire. You built once the most inclusive economy in this country’s history and you’ll build it again. Through our pledge to America’s workers, the private sector has committed to investing in the training and education of over 16 million American students and workers and this continues, despite the vast change that the plague ushered in. Companies like Udacity, Sebastian Thrun joins us today, had been leading the way, and they’d been using their pledge commitment and fulfilling it by providing free tech training to American workers laid off as a result of COVID.
Ivanka Trump: (08:31)
I recently had the opportunity to virtually meet one of the students that went through your program and received your scholarship in conjunction with the pledge and it was incredible. His name was Tony, he was a lifelong truck driver, he owned his own business, it was a single rig that he had. Through a series of setbacks, the company ended up going under. He signed up for a course in tech and is now a software engineer providing for his family, absolutely loving what he does, and there are many, many stories like Tony that hopefully will inspire millions across the nation. Marillyn Hewson, also an early pledge signed, of Lockheed-Martin committed to hiring during the pandemic using virtual technologies and other techniques to ensure recruitment processes move forward. So with more people teleworking and learning from home than ever before, we have a lot to accomplish in the months ahead and I’m really excited about your effort to extend this working group and to reform our federal hiring practices as we think about building that inclusive American economy as we transition to greatness. So thank you for today and it’s a pleasure to have you join us.
Donald Trump: (09:39)
Thank you very much honey. Great job. Really has been. It’s been a labor of love.
Ivanka Trump: (09:44)
It’s true.
Donald Trump: (09:44)
Ivanka loves helping people. It’s a wonderful thing. Marillyn, how about starting with you?
Marillyn Hewson: (09:51)
Well thank you Mr. President. It’s really an honor to serve on this policy board and I must say I agree with you [inaudible 00:09:57] Trump, Ivanka Trump and Secretary Ross have led us well. We had a great effort over the last several meetings and put forward some strong recommendations that I hope to match the skills together with the jobs that are there and at Lockheed-Martin we’re proud that this year we’re on a path to hire 12,000 people and a lot of it is around making sure that we are getting the kind of apprenticeships and scholarships and skills training for them so that they can link up to jobs in our operation. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (10:26)
Well you’ve done a great job and I got to see it again. I mentioned it was so impressive what I saw, the whole group yesterday. It was really great to be there and I didn’t know you had a big chunk of that one but you’ve done very well with it so we appreciate it. Please Sebastian.
Sebastian Thrun: (10:44)
It’s a great honor to meet you and I want to thank you for keeping us safe and moving us forward. This has been of course a wild time for all of us with over 30 million unemployed. It’s our chance to really redefine how education looks like and move into a world where people learn lifelong, have lifelong access and can really unfold their livelihoods. Ivanka was of course the visionary behind all this and thank you for doing this. Mentioned Tony [Boswell 00:11:10], a truck driver who was driving trucks for 10 years and then his truck broke down and it he couldn’t finance the new engine that he needed and he was unemployed, had no income, no education and came across by randomness a Google scholarship that Udacity launched, and then in ten months’ time was really able to become a software engineer. These are the stories that I believe this nation needs. I think we have so much opportunity, so much potential in this great nation, to bring people forward and I think this is the time to do it.
Donald Trump: (11:39)
That’s a great story. It’s a great story, amazing story. Ginni, please.
Ginni Rometty: (11:46)
Well first Mr. President thank you for your leadership during this time.
Donald Trump: (11:49)
Thank you. Thank you.
Ginni Rometty: (11:50)
You used an important word when you described Ivanka’s contribution here as a labor of love because this is something I think what the team has done collectively will have a very longterm impact, as well as short-term, and we are solving probably … Working towards helping solve one of the most important programs for growth for the country as well, so to help anyone from any socioeconomic background. So my hat is off and thanks to Secretary Ross and to Ivanka for having led us through this and I think we have put on the table is substantive change and I know it is change to a company like mine. So as you signed Skills First, we’ve adopted that and 15% of our hires last year were people from non-traditional backgrounds and so it’s really what this is all about I think and giving everyone a bright future in the digital era so thank you for that.
Donald Trump: (12:42)
Thank you very much Ginni. Good job. Eric? Go ahead please.
Eric Holcomb: (12:46)
Well, just to add my appreciation. I mean what you’re doing today is leveling the playing field and there’s been a lot of people, a lot of have nots that will have an opportunity to join the haves and to do it during a time of such challenge but to recognize the opportunity that’s here and to do it now, there couldn’t be a more important time so I appreciate everyone’s effort around this table and your leadership on this front.
Donald Trump: (13:11)
And Indiana’s doing very well I’m hearing? Good things.
Eric Holcomb: (13:14)
We are. We are moving in the right direction. We’ve got 93,000 unfilled jobs right now that we need to fill. We’ve ushered in 100,000 jobs in just three and a half years, the previous record was 93,000 in four years. These are high wage, high demand jobs, these are $28.00 north an hour.
Donald Trump: (13:35)
That’s great.
Eric Holcomb: (13:35)
So this is what it’s all about, scaling up the workforce. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (13:38)
That’s great. Great job. Thank you very much. Kim?
Kim Reynolds: (13:43)
Well thank you Mr. President and what I so appreciate about your administration is it’s really an administration of action. You identify barriers and gaps and then you help bring the right people together to find the solutions and enact those so thank you very much. It’s been an honor to be a part of this advisory board. I appreciate how … With the leadership of Ivanka and Secretary Ross, we really have identified the various elements, connected those elements whether it’s been consistent data, definition, goals and messaging, and I look forward to really amplifying that in the state of Iowa. By executive order I just created an economic taskforce. I brought several CEOs, business leaders and non-profits together to utilize their expertise in the way through innovation, adaptation and creativity, adjusted within weeks to the coronavirus and everything that this group has talked about will fold so well into what we’re trying to do at the state level and when you think about that happening in every state across the country, we really are going to come back stronger and better and really help provide opportunities for every single American so thank you for leading it.
Donald Trump: (14:54)
All right, and we see it now Kim. Next year is going to be we think amazing actually.
Kim Reynolds: (14:59)
Yep. I agree.
Donald Trump: (14:59)
It’s going to be an amazing year. Larry? Would you like to say something?
Larry Kudlow: (15:02)
Yeah, thanks sir. I spoke just before you came but I’ll just repeat the V-shaped recovery virtually every number is showing a V-shaped recovery now. Private surveys, government statistics, restaurants, homebuilders, truckers, durable goods makers, [inaudible 00:15:20] mobility and travel, gasoline demand. As you said the jobs went up really three million in May. We had tremendous retail sales. Actually today in the income report we had tremendous consumer spending, 8% at an annual rate for one month, it’s a great story.
Donald Trump: (15:39)
That’s a great number.
Larry Kudlow: (15:40)
I still think we’ll get 20% in the second half of the year and if we get another 5% in the first quarter of next year, we will be right back to the peak in 2019 where you got us the first time with the growth policies and I just want to say Ivanka, I gave you a big pitch, did the best I could. Private sector re-skilling and retraining and not only will people come back to the labor force when they’re re-skilled, they’ll come back with higher wages and they’ll come back with more confidence and it will make a huge difference as it already has and so I have added you to the four pillars of growth, the president.
Donald Trump: (16:23)
Good.
Larry Kudlow: (16:23)
Tax cuts.
Donald Trump: (16:24)
Good taste.
Larry Kudlow: (16:25)
Deregulation, energy unleashing, fair trade deals and private sector-led rescaling, how is that sir?
Donald Trump: (16:33)
That’s great. That’s great, and I’m very happy, what you said about early next year. I think next year is going to be an incredible year. Thank you very much Larry.
Larry Kudlow: (16:42)
I appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (16:42)
Wilbur, would you like to say something?
Wilbur Ross: (16:45)
Yes Mr. President. Thank you for the opportunity to help, Ivanka and the others on this group. I’ve been very, very impressed with the productivity of this advisory board. Most advisory boards create a big thick book at the end that goes in the library and nothing happens. This group, every single meeting there’s a specific tangible thing that gets followed up and it gets implemented so it’s really been a heartwarming thing to see how productive these folks have been and I congratulate all of them.
Donald Trump: (17:20)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Gene, please.
Gene Scalia: (17:25)
Thank you Mr. President and you mentioned the 3.5% unemployment rate just a few months ago. You did so many things for the American worker during those three years. Back in the summer of 2016, the Congressional Budget Office said that we’d be at 5% unemployment in February. They said that between and February 2020 they said we’d create 1.9 million jobs, we created seven million jobs. Larry touched on it, it was policies of tax cuts, of deregulation which brought us there which was just a wonderful thing for the American worker as jobs were being created and wages were rising but there was other work going on. What you see today is a manifestation of other things that were being done that are now going to have their day to really help workers. We are coming back. Larry’s mentioned some of the numbers, but we know that training will be important and we’re fortunate that this really very extraordinary group and as Secretary Ross has said, a group that really generated valuable product, they were working quietly to help train American workers. I spoke earlier about a new apprenticeship rule that we adopted in the Labor Department that I think will be very helpful. This will be an important part of the rebound.
Donald Trump: (18:36)
Thank you Gene very much. Appreciate it. Steve, please.
Steve: (18:40)
Thank you Mr. President. As others said, your economic team working with you knew how to create jobs and created an enormous amount and because of this virus which unfortunately shut down the economy we know how to reopen the economy safely. Working with Congress we put $3 trillion in. It’s beginning to work, we see it and our work isn’t going to be done until every single one of these jobs is done. We know we need a few more tools, we’ll go back to Congress next month but we’re going to get everybody back to work and I’m confident we’re going to see a strong third and fourth quarter as we reopen.
Donald Trump: (19:13)
That’s great Steve. Thank you very much. Anybody else would like to say something? Anybody? Anybody? This is your chance, go ahead please.
Speaker 13: (19:21)
Mr. President I just want to say as your domestic policy chief what an extraordinary day today is and here’s why. It’s not just the work of this council and the leadership of Ivanka, it is the executive order that you are about to sign that completely resets the playing field. The federal government is the largest employer in the country with two million employees. Two-thirds of American adults do not have a college degree. Your signature that is recalibrating the work force away from being degree only to skill set is transformational and the opportunity for you to fight for all Americans, I think about Tony that Ivanka talked about, that Sebastian talked about from Udacity, from a truck driver to a software engineer, next potentially into the federal government because of this executive order that is focusing on skills rather than degrees. Congratulations and thank you for your leadership. It’s extraordinary.
Donald Trump: (20:19)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Anybody? Jovita.
Jovita Carranza: (20:20)
Yes, President Trump, thank you very much for your strong leadership. I sit in the audience here as part of a participation of this particular advisory board and I am a recipient of the type of programs that you are actually implementing and supporting. I started as a box handler in the world’s largest logistics company and so when I hear everyone talk about the dedication of the workforce and establishing some really comprehensive training, I took advantage of every training opportunity there was in that private sector and perhaps you’ll see another administrator similar to me based on the programs that you’re going to advocate and support. Because of the public-private partnerships that this administration has enabled, the paycheck protection program, just one example that has to four to five small businesses sustain their viability and also protected their employees, a baseline of about 60 million employees. So I thank you again for putting small businesses front and center.
Jovita Carranza: (21:27)
One other comment. I’m looking at all of these private sector companies, the super leaders in your various sectors. You are the primary contractors for the subcontractors that I represent as an advocate for small business administration, so once you reinstate your viability, the small business sector will then follow soon after so thank you again.
Donald Trump: (21:56)
Thank you very much Jovita. Thank you very much.
Speaker 15: (21:59)
Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (22:00)
Please.
Speaker 15: (22:01)
I just appreciate your unrelenting focus on creating opportunity for all Americans and that begins with opportunities in education and I so appreciate your leadership there and it’s been a privilege to be part of this Ivanka and Secretary Ross, thank you for your work here in policy and action as Governor Reynolds said and thank you for your leadership.
Donald Trump: (22:29)
Choice. How is that going, choice, right?
Speaker 15: (22:32)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (22:32)
That’s what we want. Please.
Scott Pulsipher: (22:34)
I was just going to say thank you Mr. President. From a university’s perspective, it’s often perceived as skills versus degrees but in reality in a skills denominated future it is that tide that lifts all boats because even those who possess degrees, they can better articulate the skills and competencies that they now have for the future of work and the reality is too is that it’s also more fair, it’s more equitable, it’s more prosperous for our workforce because what it really is is it’s now about what you possess and what you can demonstrate, not how you acquired the competency and skill. So it just creates much more of an equitable pathway and WGU is a competency-based education provider, as always been focused on how do you articulate the outcomes of achieving a degree in a skills and competency-based way so it’s much more aligned with the future of work and so it is truly that tide that lifts all boats. This is a huge step in the right direction so thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (23:31)
I agree with you 100% I must say. I do. Okay? Why don’t we sign and this is a big deal. Congratulations to everybody in the room. This means a lot. Okay. We’ll do that for Marillyn and we’ll take this. Thank you very much. Okay. That’s very good. We have pens for everybody. All right, Page Two. Thank you very much. Well thank you all very much. We appreciate it. This is really an important day for a lot of reasons but this is one of them. Thank you all for being with us. We appreciate it very much. Thank you very much."
"Jun 25, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you, Lee Greenwood. Thank you very much. Hey, it’s a good song, isn’t it? Lee Greenwood. And thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be here with you on this incredible summer day in Wisconsin on the edge of the beautiful Lake Michigan. That is beautiful too. I know it well with the legendary workers of Marinette Marine, and you now have a lot of contracts because of the United States government. You’re going to be so busy. You’re going to be so busy. I know you went through a little bit of a hard time, not anymore, not anymore. Got you covered for years.
Donald Trump: (01:13)
For more than 75 years, the workers of this shipyard have built some 1,500 of the finest and most fearsome vessels ever to sail. You’ve kept our sailors safe and our Navy strong. Every single day, you prove that American workers are the best in the world, and now you’re going to do things like you’ve never done before. Moments ago, I walked the length of the Majestic Freedom class combat ship that many of you have been pouring your hearts and souls out for over a year. Soon, that ship will be commissioned into the most powerful fleet in human history.
Donald Trump: (01:50)
We’re building up the Navy. We’ll have 350 ships. It was actually down to a level which was World War I. That’s a long time ago, isn’t it, World War I. We’re building it up very rapidly. It’s the United States Navy. It will be bigger and stronger than it ever was before. Everywhere it goes, our allies and enemies alike will know the strength and pride that symbolizes that name, USS, and there it is. Marinette, proud of it. It’s great.
Donald Trump: (02:25)
I want to thank the leadership team of Fincantieri Marinette Marine for welcoming us to this incredible place. It’s truly an incredible place, and now the world is watching because you’re here, not because I’m here, because you’re here. But the world is watching you, including I want to thank Jan Almond, Dario [Desde 00:02:46], and Vice-admiral Rick Hunt. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thanks also to Lockheed Martin executive Vice-president Stephanie Hill. Thank you, Stephanie. Great job. We’re pleased to be joined as well by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, a legend on Wall Street, and he’s putting his magic to work. Our economy is coming back at a level that nobody ever imagined possible. We’re doing great. We’re doing good. And remember, as I say all the time because we want to say this in front of the media. There they are. Look at all those people, the fake news. We have the greatest testing program in the world. We’ve developed it over a period of time, and we’re up to almost 30 million tests. That means we’re going to have more cases. If we didn’t want to test or if we didn’t test, we wouldn’t have cases. But we have cases because we test. Deaths are down. We have one of the lowest mortality rates. We’ve done an incredible historic job, and I want the people working on it and not me, but I want all of those people on the task force that have done such a great job on the testing, on the ventilators. We’re now making thousands of ventilators a week. When we started, we weren’t making ventilators. We didn’t have them, and other people didn’t have it. We had very few. Now we’re helping other countries with the ventilator problem, a little bit like ships. They’re complicated to make. They’re big, they’re expensive, and we’re making now thousands a week, and we’re helping many other countries. They call, and they need help because this horrible virus has hit 188 countries, if you can believe it. It came from China, and it hit 188 countries. Not good, not good.
Donald Trump: (04:40)
I want to thank Wisconsin state representatives John Nygren and Mary Felzkowski. Mary, thank you very much. John, thank you very much. Thank you both. And Marinette mayor, Steve Genisot, thank you, Steve, wherever you may be. Thank you very much. Thank you. We’re here today to celebrate the resounding victory for all of you, for Wisconsin, for the United States military and for an entire nation. Our nation is very proud of Wisconsin. Not long ago, the future of this historic shipyard was looking… Can I use the word bleak? Yes, I think we can. It was looking bleak. You were down to 44 people that was getting ready to close up. Then a lot of good things came along.
Donald Trump: (05:25)
Despite your extraordinary service to our country over the generations, this beloved facility, the mainstay of your community by far, you were going to levels of poverty. They actually had levels of poverty that nobody would have believed with all the talent because I see that I understand manufacturing. Remember? Manufacturing was never going to come back. Well, it did come back, and it came back big. But I understand. I have an aptitude for manufacturing. And I said, “It’s got to come back, and it will come back.”
Donald Trump: (05:57)
And we were doing great, and we’ll do now even better. We’re going to have a better year next year, I think, than almost any year in our history. And we were going through the single greatest year that we’ve ever had from an employment standpoint, from a stock market standpoint. And your 401ks right now, people have 401ks. They’re very happy with President Trump right now because they’re almost at the level that they were when the virus came over, but this is a mainstay of your community. And it was facing proposed and the prospect of a final layoff and a total downsize production, downsize to almost nothing. But this past April, Marinette’s fortunes turned around, and they turned around quickly. As part of my administration’s colossal rebuilding of the United States military, we’ve totally rebuilt the military, $2.5 trillion. And some people would say, “Well, that’s out of the budget.” I said, “Let me tell you something. There is no budget when it comes to our military because we don’t want the wrong people running up the front lawn of the White House, right?”
Donald Trump: (07:05)
If they were, I don’t want to say, “Well, maybe I did a lousy job with the military, but I did a great job on the budget.” No, thank you. No, thank you. Now we have an incredible… And you know what’s the greatest part about it? The greatest missiles in the world, greatest rockets. You saw the other day one of the rockets go off so successfully. The greatest ships, the greatest ships. These are the greatest of their kind anywhere in the world, the fastest, the most powerful, the greatest of everything. And you know the beautiful thing about it, it’s all made in the USA. It’s made by you and your counterparts. It’s made in the USA, the Army tanks from Ohio.
Donald Trump: (07:46)
As part of my administration’s rebuilding of the United States military, you were awarded a contract to build the next generation of guided missile frigate for the United States Navy, the FFG(X). FX, is that good? FX.
Donald Trump: (08:02)
FX. Is that good? FX. So you got the FFGX. Yeah, that’s right. That’s pretty good. What does that stand for please? Would you please tell me? Does anybody know? FFGX? I think nobody knows, but that’s okay. It sounds good to me, but it’s going to be built right here in the American heartland and it’s going to be built by you. And it’s going to go on for a long time because it’s up to 20 ships and it might be extended, and they’re working on an extension right now and we’ll see, but just go. You’re going to be building your hearts away, so good luck on the program. The massive deal is worth up to $5.5 billion. We’ll put the shipyard to work constructing some of the fastest, most advanced and most maneuverable combat ships anywhere in the ocean. I heard that maneuverability is one of the big factors that you were chosen for the contract. The other is your location in Wisconsin, if you want to know the truth.
Donald Trump: (09:03)
This contract will support your 1,500 full time employees, and it will also enable you to hire another 1,000 people all across the shipyards in Wisconsin. It’s one of the biggest contracts you’ve ever seen in the state. An estimated 15,000 additional new jobs will be created through the Wisconsin supply chain. You notice that’s not a supply chain going through China and going through other countries. It’s called the Wisconsin. Isn’t that nice? The Wisconsin supply chain.
Donald Trump: (09:37)
That’s been bugging me for about 25 years. I think that’s why I became president, you want to know the truth. What we’ve done with your great deal, the USMCA and Canada no longer takes advantage of us like they did. People don’t realize. Oh Canada, beautiful national anthem, right? Oh Canada, but they were brutal on trade. And now they have to treat us fairly. USMCA. We got rid of the worst trade deal ever made in the history of mankind, humankind. They like me to say nowadays humankind, right? Humankind. See the ladies. I think they like it the other way just as much. Humankind. But I just want to say that we have an incredible deal and it’s going to lead to a lot of very positive things.
Donald Trump: (10:21)
With the Wisconsin supply chain, 9,000 more jobs are going to be generated because of the chain itself and it’s a truly phenomenal achievement, and I congratulate you all. It’s going to be an incredible thing. It’s all going to be made right here in Wisconsin. Under this administration, you know that American workers like you are a national treasure. You are indeed victory at sea. Victory at sea, that’s what you lead us to. Your patriotism cannot be outsourced. Your eight decades of industrial heritage could not be replicated anywhere in the world.
Donald Trump: (10:58)
That’s why we’re protecting our defense and our defensive industrial base, which we’re building up stronger and stronger and stronger. And we have other places all over the country just like this. Well, let’s say this is better okay? But that’s okay. Just don’t tell anybody I said it, but we have places, great places, incredible people, tremendously, tremendously successful people, people with tremendous talent and we’re doing other things in other locations like the missiles, like the rockets, like the tanks, like all of the things that we’re building. It’s incredible when you see it. It’s incredible. People don’t realize the talent that we have.
Donald Trump: (11:41)
We started getting away from it. We started not building in the Navy. We haven’t built enough ships. The ships that they were building, they look terrible. I changed designs. I looked at it. I said, “That’s a terrible looking ship. Let’s make it beautiful. It’ll cost you the same and maybe less.” Sometimes you can make it look great for less money. I said, “This is not a good-looking ship. Let’s change the design of it.” And I got people in and we looked at different designs, and as long as we’re going to do it … And look at what you’re doing, how beautiful it is. They gave me a beautiful model that’s absolutely … It’s like a yacht with missiles on it okay? It’s beautiful. But you know, it’s true. You can build beautifully and it costs you sometimes less money, sometimes less money.
Donald Trump: (12:26)
So that’s why we’re protecting our defensive industrial base and restoring this fundamental principle, and that’s economic security is national security. That’s what it is because you know what you were going through in this area of Wisconsin just a short period of time ago. And it wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair. As long as I’m your president, America will never lose that ship building talent or capability. It won’t lose that excellence or the expertise of the men and the women of Marinette Marine. We’ll never lose that. Never lose it. And we’ll always live by two simple rules; buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American.
Donald Trump: (13:18)
The first in class, FFGX will not just be a win for Wisconsin workers. It will also be a major victory for our Navy. And our Navy is just incredible, what we’re doing with our Navy. The stunning ships will deliver the overwhelming force, lethality and power we need to engage America’s enemies, anywhere and at any time. And with that, we don’t want to engage, but you know how you don’t have to engage? When you build a product like you’re building right there. When you build product like that, you don’t have to. When you don’t build product like that, and we go bare … We rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. When I became your president, we had planes that were 50 years old. We had a military that was tired. It was very tired from years of fighting, endless wars, wars that never stopped, and you see what’s happening at that front.
Donald Trump: (14:14)
We have the strongest military in the world by far and before we had an old, we had a very tired military. What we had were great people in the military, but they weren’t given the right equipment so now they are; two and a half trillion dollars. Each [inaudible 00:14:30] will boast a 32-cell vertical missile launcher to take American justice to any foe if necessary on air, land or sea. You know about it very well. You live with it. The ship will fuel the most advanced air research and air search radar capability in Naval history. There’s never been anything so advanced as what you’re building. Amazing. The ship is 30 times more powerful than the previous generation. That was one that got me. 30 times, think of that. 30 times more powerful than the previous generation, and it will carry an MH60 Seahawk helicopter and an unmanned MQHC Fire Scout drone.
Donald Trump: (15:22)
Through your sweat skill and devotion, the workers of this shipyard will forge the future of the United States Navy. You’re going to be a very big part of the United States Navy and there are other things coming. As you get set up with this, this is a lot to handle, but as you get set up, they’re going to be spending a lot of money on the renovation of the yard and the expansion of the yard. We have other things coming. And you’ll fashion the ultimate symbol of American power and American prestige. Wherever the FFGX cuts across the horizon, it will go as a 7,500 ton message to the world that American might is second to none.
Donald Trump: (16:01)
… Is second to none. That’s right. I’d like to take a moment to recognize just a few of the hardworking patriots who are helping to bring these monumental ships to life. And that’s what they are. Gary Iad is the third generation of his family to serve at this shipyard. He has worked here for 17 years and is now a production manager. Gary, please come up and say a few words, Gary. Thank you.
Gary Iad: (16:30)
Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to be here. My name is Gary. I’m a production manager here at Fincantieri Marinette Marine. I work in building 10, the one you just toured, the erection facility. I have been fortunate enough to be employed here for over 17 years. I started in the trades and through hard work and dedication I transitioned into management. These employees in front of you are here to build the best ships possible. The sense of pride felt when a ship gets launched or goes out on trials is like nothing else. These men and women breathe life into steel. Through hard work, long hours and dedication these individuals give the American war fighter, the ship he or she needs and deserves. Mr. President, Wisconsin, thanks you. The city of Marinette thanks you and Fincantieri Marinette Marine thanks you.
Donald Trump: (17:34)
Thank you very much, Gary.
Donald Trump: (17:40)
He looks like he’s 21 years old. He said he worked here a long time. Gary, whatever you’re doing it’s working. You look good. We’re also joined by Tyler Cahill. Tyler served for nine years in the US Navy, then returned here to his hometown to become a quality technical coordinator. Tyler also helps recruit young, talented people. Usually, I guess, from Wisconsin. I think probably, I don’t know if he accepts anybody from anywhere else. You’ll have to talk about that, I think. But I want to just ask Tyler, please come up and say a few words. Take you Tyler.
Tyler Cahill: (18:23)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (18:24)
Thank you.
Tyler Cahill: (18:25)
Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Tyler Cahill. I’m a native to the Marinette area, a former second class petty officer in the United States Navy Seabees, an Afghanistan War vet, a hockey coach and a quality coordinator here at Marinette Marine. When I first moved back to Marinette and started here as a welder in 2012, I would have never imagined how far my career and community would grow. The shipyard is a lifeline to the community and a driving force behind its economic growth. In major part due to the LCS program and the newly awarded frigate contract, I’ve seen young families move to the area, friends open new local businesses and a beautiful new sports facility opened to be utilized by the local hockey kids that I get to coach. None of this would have been possible without these contracts. So, once again, Mr. President, I’d like to say thank you in allowing us to continue supporting our nation’s Navy. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (19:23)
Thank you, Tyler.
Donald Trump: (19:27)
He looks like a tough hockey player. I wouldn’t want to be checking him, right? Tyler is a pretty tough looking guy. The dedication of the men and women here today will also help our military accomplish one of my top national security priorities, rebuilding a 355 ship Navy. As I told you, it went way down. Very sad. After years of painful budget cuts, we ended the last administration’s disastrous defense sequester. We ended the sequester. You know what that means, I think most of you? Let’s put it that way or this way, it was a very good thing that we did, otherwise you wouldn’t be building these ships right now. We ended what was a true disaster.
Donald Trump: (20:15)
We’ve invested the $2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world and it’s all made here right in the USA and a lot of it is going to be made in Wisconsin, outside of this facility also. And I signed a new law creating, very importantly, this was something very important to me, the sixth branch of the US military, the space force. That’s a big deal. That’s a big deal. We’re revitalizing our partnerships around the world and insisting that other nations pay their fair share in NATO. They weren’t paying up and now many of them are. Some of them still don’t pay like they should, they’re delinquent. You know that word? They’re delinquent.
Donald Trump: (20:57)
No other president pressed them to pay. I press them to pay and the people at NATO are very happy with me, I will tell you. The secretary general said, “There’s never been anything like it. We took in $140 billion more money from other people, not from us, from other people paying their bills.” Because for many years they didn’t pay their bills. We were guarding nations and they weren’t paying for it. And somehow I said, “That doesn’t work too well.” Not for me and not for you either because you’re smart. This is great news for American workers and taxpayers as part of Saudi Arabia’s effort to fulfill its own defense obligations. Last year, the kingdom placed a $1.3 billion order for four new vessels made by your great company. So, you know the vessels that are getting built right now and we felt very strongly that this is where it should be and we gave them a strong recommendation and they followed it. That’s very good.
Donald Trump: (21:55)
Since 1942, when your company was founded to build five wooden barges for World War II, this small town in Wisconsin has raised up one of the premier ship building enterprises anywhere on earth and if you come back here in five years, you’ll see one of the top places anywhere in the world. You should take immense pride in what you’ve done and those before you, in many cases, your fathers and your grandfathers, in many cases, your fathers are alive and very proud of the job you’re doing. I met three people whose fathers worked here and it looked like it was ending and now they work here and they’re going to be here for a long time. And I said, “Get your son ready or get your daughter ready.” Your tradition of excellence has given America two classes of combat ships, the coast guard cutters that patrol our maritime borders, a state-of-the-art icebreaker, which is incredible, which we had not an easy time getting approved, I will tell you that. Democrats don’t like approving money for the military for whatever reason, some day you’ll explain that to me, they don’t like spending money on our military, and several of the Staten Island ferries, and so much more doing a lot of work.
Donald Trump: (23:10)
The workers of the shipyard and the people of this state have always prospered and persevered by holding fast to our shared American values. In this country we honor work, we celebrate great craftsmanship. I understand craftsmanship. I understand this world so well, you wouldn’t believe it. You wouldn’t believe it how well I understand it and how well I appreciate it. I appreciate talent and that’s real talent, craftsmanship. And we salute the dignity and nobility of the American worker. We look out for one that you wouldn’t believe. We look out for everybody. We’ll look out for one another. We’re loyal to one another and we love our families. We want our families taken care of. We want our families to prosper. We want our community to prosper. This community was not prospering with all that talent they-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
But this community was not prospering. With all that talent, they weren’t prospering, and now you’re all working and doing something that you love. I know most of you, you can’t wait to get to work. That’s the way I feel, and your job is much more pleasant than mine. That I can guarantee. That I can guarantee. You don’t know what I have to go through with these people. They said to me, “Sir,” a friend of mine, very smart, very successful person. Used to call me Donald, now he calls me sir. He says, “Mr. President.” I said, “Call me Donald.” “Yes, but I can’t, Mr. President.” Which is okay. He said, “So, which is the toughest nation to deal with? Is it China? Is it possibly Russia? Or is it maybe North Korea?” I said, “No. The toughest nation to deal with are the Democrats in the USA.”
Donald Trump: (24:58)
The Democrats in the USA are much tougher to deal with than any of these people that we deal with. They’re far more unreasonable, and actually, they’re a little crazy. We take care of our communities, and when the time comes, when history calls, when our flag is threatened, we defend our country like nobody else has ever defended our country or our flag. We defend our flag. We stand tall, we stand strong, and we always stand proud of the United States of America. With the help of everyone here today, this shipyard will continue to prosper, this state will continue to thrive, and this nation that we love will climb to new heights of glory and to greatness, and that’s what’s happening right now. We’re going to have a great third quarter and we’re going to have a phenomenal next year, you’ll see.
Donald Trump: (25:56)
Next year will be one of the greatest years. You see it happening already. It’s happening and it’s happening quickly. So, I want to thank everybody at this amazing yard. I want to thank the grandparents and the parents who put you here. They’re very proud of you. Some are looking down on you right now. They’re looking down from heaven, and they’re very proud of you. They’re very, very proud, and I’m also very proud of you. So, congratulations to you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.

"Jun 25, 2020","Sean Hannity: (00:00)
And now, here’s my town hall that we taped earlier today from an airplane hangar in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Now, by the way, we followed all the rules and recommendations of the county in which we’re doing this. So as to have as many people as they recommended, small crowd, but an enthusiastic group of people. Obviously, because of all that we’ve been dealing with COVID-19, we had a lot of ground to cover tonight. Watch this. Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks for joining us. We’re going to take some audience questions throughout the hour. You’re here in Wisconsin, one of the things that everybody’s looking for and we’ll get into more detail throughout the hour is the economy, you are going to leave this town hall, and you’re going to announce that you’re building 20 new ships. You rebuilding the military and how many jobs?
Donald Trump: (00:48)
Well, it’s going to be probably 6,000, 7,000 jobs, could go up to 10 in Wisconsin alone. And it’s a great shipyard that was on hard times. And now it’s a very good shipyard and a lot of people are going to be working. And it’s one of the most beautiful ships. It looks like a yacht with a lot of ammunition on it, I will tell you. It’s really something. And we’ll probably end up with 20 or 25. And these are big ones, beautiful ships. And they do a beautiful job in Wisconsin. So I’m here, it’s sort of like a launch. We’re starting work and the contract’s all given and you won it right here, so congratulations folks.
Sean Hannity: (01:27)
We as a nation, we’ve been watching, it was universal agreement that what happened to George Floyd should never happen, can never happen again. And you’ve been very outspoken about it as well. And they were peaceful protestors, but then there were people rioting. We see anarchy, we see rocks and bottles and bricks and Molotov cocktails thrown at police officers, police precincts burn to the ground. In Seattle, an autonomous zone that still remains, is changing apparently today but taken over, including a police precinct. And you’re offering all of these states help, New York, Illinois, and Washington. What are they telling you when you offer them help?
Donald Trump: (02:07)
Well, first of all, we have arrested, I think almost, but it could be over the number, hundreds of people. We have arrested a lot of people for what they’ve done. They’ve created bedlam. They’ve destroyed very important things. I mean, you’re also talking about statues of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. They’d like to get Jesus, you know that, right? They said, “We want to get Jesus.”
Sean Hannity: (02:28)
Yeah, you had Shaun King, the radical.
Donald Trump: (02:30)
These have nothing to do with any particular event, other than they’re troublemakers or agitators. And they’re anarchists. The big thing they want is they want to really destabilize our country and we don’t let them. So I said to my people, “If you’ve arrested so many, how come we don’t know about it?” They said, “We don’t talk about it, sir, we do it.” But I said, “I think the public should know it.” And we have a statues act, a monument act, which puts you in jail for 10 years if you do what they’ve done. So we’ve got that. We’ve got all the tapes because the nice part is it’s all on television. Like the character on the horse the other day, he’s up there putting on the ropes. He’s in trouble, on the Andrew Jackson … beautiful, it’s beautiful, right opposite the White House.
Donald Trump: (03:09)
And you got to remember Andrew Jackson, the Battle of New Orleans and so much. He was a very good president. He was a great general and you can’t let that happen. But they’re after Abraham Lincoln and tonight, I guess they’re looking at Abraham Lincoln and that was the Emancipation Proclamation. So you have that and you’re signing Emancipation Proclamation and you have somebody, I think that wasn’t freed, and he’s getting up. It’s the position of, he’s getting up. He’s being freed by Abraham Lincoln. And I can see controversy, but I can also see beauty in it. And it was paid for by slaves. I don’t know if you know that, it was paid for because they were so grateful to the president.
Donald Trump: (03:51)
It was paid for that reason and they want to take it down. And we can take things down too, I can understand certain things being taken down. But they ought to go through a process legally and then we take it down. In some cases, put them in museums or wherever they may go. But these are really rioters and they’re a lot of bad people involved. They talk about protestors and they’re protestors, but there are beyond protesters too, and we’re not going to allow it. So we have many, many people under arrest and we have some just from the other night in Washington, but I’m talking about in other states also.
Sean Hannity: (04:26)
You’ve offered help to New York-
Donald Trump: (04:28)
Excuse me, by the way, and Washington is not D.C., not a state. Because if I say that, a little statement like that, sometimes I’ll say, should I correct myself? Because the fake news will say, “He thought D.C. was a state.” So I just want to make that clear so they can’t do it, okay.
Sean Hannity: (04:43)
Always predicting ahead.
Donald Trump: (04:43)
Oh, by the way, they do it all the time. You know what I mean?
Sean Hannity: (04:48)
Let’s talk about these states though. You see your old city, you’re now a Florida resident. You’re going to save a lot of money on taxes. There’s no state income tax in Florida, but you see New York City, 350% increase. You see in Chicago last weekend, 102 of our fellow citizens were shot. 12 were children and 14 died. The carnage existed all throughout these years that Joe Biden was vice president. Barack was president. I don’t know any reforms that they put in place after Ferguson or after Baltimore or many other incidents.
Donald Trump: (05:22)
Yeah, they did virtually nothing. And I call him Corrupt Joe, he’s corrupt. And you look at that administration. They have had more … and wait until you see what’s happening. Because you saw the notes now from the Oval Office meeting and all of the things-
Sean Hannity: (05:34)
We’re going to get to that.
Donald Trump: (05:34)
What’s happening is a disgrace. This is a corrupt situation. We caught them spying on my campaign. They were spying. I said that a long time ago, remember, but I said it without great knowledge. It turned out to be correct. They were spying on my campaign. And if that were the other way around, if it was switched with Democrat and Republican, the opposite way, you’d have people in jail for 50 years for they did because that’s treason. That’s a terrible thing what they did. And what they’ve done to people like General Flynn and like others is disgraceful, it’s disgraceful.
Sean Hannity: (06:08)
I want to get back to that. I want to stay on this issue though. If we are to become a more perfect union and if we really want to pursue happiness, we first have to have law and order.
Donald Trump: (06:19)
Correct.
Sean Hannity: (06:20)
Okay, these big cities, we’ve watched Chicago violence now for how long? All through the Obama, Joe Biden administration.
Donald Trump: (06:29)
Years ago.
Sean Hannity: (06:30)
They barely mentioned it in eight years. You see Seattle, you see New York City. We see now people dying in the autonomous zone. I don’t know how people can pursue their happiness and dreams in life, if they don’t have basic fundamental security.
Donald Trump: (06:45)
You can’t, you can’t. Look, Chicago’s an example. It’s like worse than Afghanistan. It’s worse than, I shouldn’t say because they’re working with us, Honduras, Guatemala, they’re all working with us now. You know, we have our lowest numbers. We have phenomenal numbers on the border. Border patrol has done a great job. We built 220 miles of wall. It’s going up very rapidly. We should be doing about 10 miles a week now. And we’re going to have … it will be completed very soon. But what we’ve done there is incredible. But you look at Honduras, Guatemala, all of these different places. We have cities that are worse. In some cases, far worse. Take a look at Detroit, take a look at what’s happening in Oakland. Take a look at what’s happening in Baltimore. And everyone gets upset when I say it, they say, “Oh, is that a racist statement?” It’s not a racist.
Donald Trump: (07:38)
Frankly, Black people come up to me say, “Thank you, thank you sir, for saying it.” They want help, these cities, it’s like living in hell. But last week and I think two weeks before that, they shot 14 and 18 people killed and 68 people in Chicago.
Sean Hannity: (07:59)
104 last weekend.
Donald Trump: (08:01)
If I’ve ever seen a case, I know it’s very controversial to say stop and frisk, okay. Stop and frisk, you take guns away. Chicago is the greatest example I think I’ve ever seen of that. Rudy Giuliani was a great mayor, he did it in New York. He started it and it worked great. Bloomberg blew it because he went crazy with it. And ultimately it took away a lot of rights and a lot of, it wasn’t a good job he did. But Rudy Giuliani started stop and frisk and he did a great, it was a great thing he did for New York.
Sean Hannity: (08:33)
The murder rate went, for those that don’t know, I lived in New York City at the time, went from around 2,500 a year, they drove it all the way down to 500. And what they did is they went into the areas that had the highest incidents of crime.
Donald Trump: (08:48)
That’s right.
Sean Hannity: (08:48)
And saved a lot of lives. So we’re Americans, I think we can do anything. I’m that optimistic, we could stop the violence, right, we could-
Donald Trump: (08:55)
Could stop it quickly. And at some point in the not too distant future, I’m going to do it. And if they don’t do something with Seattle, we’re going to do that. We’re going to go in there because what’s happening, they’re taking over American cities. By the way, in all cases, it’s Democrats, they’re Democrat run, in all cases. And Joe Biden would have that be the whole country. It’s so crazy what’s happening. Here’s a guy, doesn’t talk. Nobody hears him. Whenever he does talk, he can’t put two sentences together. I don’t want to be nice or un-nice, okay. But I mean, the man can’t speak and he’s going to be your president because some people don’t love me maybe and all I’m doing is doing my job. Don’t forget, before the China plague came in and it’s the China plague, before that came in, we had the best job numbers we’ve ever had.
Donald Trump: (09:43)
We had the best economy we’ve ever had. We had the best stock market we’ve ever had, which by the way, is getting very close to those numbers anyway. And in NASDAQ, it’s actually beat those numbers. But we have the best numbers we’ve ever had. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, women, young people without a diploma, young people with a diploma, college, everything, everything. We had the best numbers we’ve ever had, the best economy we’ve ever had. I was absolutely doing a number on China. Not that I want to, but we’re taking billions and billions away. China ran away from us when we had … they were going to take over our country. If I didn’t come along, they would have taken over our country. What they did to Obama and Biden, they ripped off this country, hundreds of billions of dollars a year, going into China. And nobody said anything. They didn’t even talk about it.
Donald Trump: (10:33)
You know, it’s not like we had a bad deal with China. It was worse, we had no deal. They did whatever and I get along very well with them. I said, “How did it happen?” They said, “Nobody ever asked.” Nobody said, we’ve got to make a deal. We’re taking in hundreds of billions of dollars worth of tariffs. And we’re not paying for them, China is paying for them because they devalue their currency. So we’ve done an incredible job. We beat China badly. China had the worst year they’ve had 67 years, prior to the plague coming in, they had the-
Donald Trump: (11:03)
In 67 years prior to the plague coming in, they had the worst year they had in 67 years because of the tariffs and all of the things that I’ve done. But he’ll say, “He got beat in the China deal.” They didn’t do a China deal. China ate our lunch before me, and they would have destroyed our country. China, in my opinion, would have destroyed our country economically if I didn’t get elected, and many other things. Coronavirus … we did the ventilators. We didn’t have any ventilators. We did the ventilators. We did so much.
Sean Hannity: (11:28)
Ten days after the first identified case of coronavirus in the United States-
Donald Trump: (11:33)
Right.
Sean Hannity: (11:33)
You implemented a travel ban, followed by a quarantine that hadn’t had happened in 50 years, and then subsequent travel bans. Joe said it was hysteria, xenophobic, and-
Donald Trump: (11:45)
That’s right. Terrible.
Sean Hannity: (11:46)
… fear mongering.
Donald Trump: (11:46)
Well, he didn’t say it. They have people that … I’ll make a statement. It’ll be a nice statement. It’ll be a little complex, or maybe it’s not complex. And they will have that statement analyzed, and they’ll say, “Vice President Biden said …” and they’ll have it broken down to … And I said, “He didn’t say that. He never said xenophobic, because I don’t think he knows what the word means.” But he said it was xenophobic. It was horrible. I made it … that was at the end of January. That’s very early. January.
Sean Hannity: (12:12)
January 31st.
Donald Trump: (12:13)
Nancy Pelosi and many other people, including Republicans, were … months later, they were saying, “Let’s go to Chinatown and celebrate.” Nancy Pelosi was celebrating- [crosstalk 00:12:23]
Sean Hannity: (12:23)
February 24th.
Donald Trump: (12:24)
Correct. In the streets of Chinatown. You know, there’s no business like this. You could do a great job like Schumer. I did a phenomenal job on a trade deal, and they asked him, “What’d you think of the deal?”
Donald Trump: (12:38)
“I didn’t like it. No good. No good.” He never even saw the deal. It’s just an automatic thing. You hear the sound of that helicopter? Is that a beautiful sound?
Sean Hannity: (12:45)
Beautiful sound.
Donald Trump: (12:46)
Made in the USA. It’s all made in the US.
Sean Hannity: (12:50)
You mentioned earlier [inaudible 00:01:51]. Look, I was a little surprised. I’m not going to lie. They had predicted for May 9.5 million jobs lost. We ended up gaining 2.5 million.
Donald Trump: (13:03)
Almost three.
Sean Hannity: (13:04)
We had the largest retail sales month … I don’t know if you all saw the numbers. 18%. That’s a record. Here’s my list-
Donald Trump: (13:11)
And we had a pretty good number come out today on jobs, too.
Sean Hannity: (13:14)
I didn’t see that number.
Donald Trump: (13:15)
Also, better than projected. But more importantly … So, we have more cases because we do the greatest testing. If we didn’t do testing, we’d have no cases. Other countries, they don’t test millions. So, up to almost 30 million tests. When you do 30 million … You’re going to have a kid with the sniffles, and they’ll say, “It’s coronavirus, whatever you want to call it.” I said the other night, “There were so many names to this, I could name 19 names like CORONA-19,” but I could name 19 names. But the fact is that there’s never been a thing like this. We’ve done 30 million … almost. We’ll be there probably today or tomorrow. 30 million tests.
Donald Trump: (13:53)
Now, when you do tests, you have cases. But what they don’t say is there are fewer deaths than they have been way. Way, way down. Our mortality rate is among the best countries in the world meaning people that die, because a lot of these tests, it’s a case. It’s a kid that doesn’t even know. In some cases, it’s people that didn’t even know they were sick. Maybe they weren’t, but it shows up in a test. So, they’ll say 30 million tests. Now, you have a big percentage of that, but other countries do very few tests. So, it shows very few cases. Sometimes I jokingly say or sarcastically say, “If we didn’t do tests, we’d look great.” You know what? It’s not the right thing to do.
Sean Hannity: (14:30)
Treatment vaccine. Where are we?
Donald Trump: (14:33)
I think the vaccines are coming along great. And I think the … what they call therapeutics are coming along great. I think we’re going to have an answer very soon. Very soon, indeed. I think it will be even before the end of the year, we’ll have a vaccine. We have great companies, and we’re totally mobilized. Military is doing it. We’re ready to go. As soon as they have it, we will be distributing that all over the country.
Sean Hannity: (14:56)
Let me go. You had talked about my list earlier. Joe Biden was Vice President for eight years. He has a record that at some point, I assume, somebody might have to ask him, or maybe you will when you debate him if he shows up … which is a question we will find out in the future. But 13 million more Americans after eight years were on Food Stamps, 8 million more in poverty, the lowest labor participation rates since the ’70s.
Donald Trump: (15:22)
Right.
Sean Hannity: (15:22)
Worst recovery since the ’40s, lowest home ownership rate in 15 years. Now, I look at your record. Pre-coronavirus, we had record after record low unemployment with every … African Americans, Hispanic Americans, you know the list. Even African American youth unemployment. I want to get to the issue, because it seems like if we look, and compare, and contrast historically Black colleges of five-year commitment with more money than ever before, opportunity zones, I think one of the biggest changes is-
Donald Trump: (15:55)
Criminal justice.
Sean Hannity: (15:56)
Criminal justice reform.
Donald Trump: (15:58)
Well, the biggest thing, criminal justice reform. Obama and Biden never even tried it. That was something so important for the Black community. They came to me. They wanted it so badly, because it is … it’s a very unfair situation. And they came-
Sean Hannity: (16:13)
Unfair to minorities.
Donald Trump: (16:16)
And especially Black and Hispanic. It’s so unfair. And I said, “Why wasn’t this done before?” Now, Obama didn’t try. If he did, he may come out and say, “We did try,” but he didn’t get it done. I got it done. People said, “You wouldn’t be able to get it done.” I got it done with the help of some very good Republicans that frankly … they could have gone either way on it, to be honest. Although we had some very strong conservative Republicans, like Mike Lee. Republicans that wanted it very much. Chuck Grassley. Some great, strong conservative Republicans that wanted it very much.
Donald Trump: (16:51)
It was both ways. Very unusual. You had some very strong conservatives, and you also had some really, really liberal people. But we did criminal justice reform. Nobody thought it was possible to get it done. I got it done. They couldn’t get it done. Then they’ll say such horrible things. I mean, on the campaign they’ll say such horrible things about me. It’s a very unfair business. But it’s a great ad for them. “I got beaten by China.” Wrong. I beat China very badly. [crosstalk 00:17:22] I didn’t do this coronavirus.
Sean Hannity: (17:24)
I might take Joe’s side though, because I don’t think your son got 1.5 billion dollars.
Donald Trump: (17:31)
That’s right. That’s right. It’s a way of looking at it. I’ll tell you. Now, nobody’s ever seen anything like that. But what they’ll do is they’ll take five or six points, and just say I lost. If you look at what we’ve done on ventilators, on testing, again, where we have 30 million … Germany is second with maybe 4, maybe 5 million. Germany is going to show fewer cases because they’re testing far fewer people. Different sized countries and all, but they’re testing far fewer people. But many countries don’t do testing like that, so it shows we’re way up in testing.
Donald Trump: (18:01)
But what it also shows by doing that … in all fairness, it shows a very, very low mortality rate. Just about the lowest. We’re right at the bottom in a positive way. I think that people are starting to see it. But if I don’t do a show like this, which is live or semi-live … If I don’t do a show like this, we’re not going to get the word out. Because the press is really corrupt and dishonest. I can’t believe it. I used to say, “Fake news. Fake news.” It’s much worse than fake news. And it’s not only what they say. It’s what they don’t say.
Sean Hannity: (18:34)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (18:34)
Something great could be happening, and they refuse to report it.
Sean Hannity: (18:37)
You mentioned General Flynn. We saw Peter Strzok. A lot of it was redacted, my sources have been telling me. In this program-
Donald Trump: (18:46)
It’s big stuff.
Sean Hannity: (18:46)
I’ve devoted almost three years to unpeeling every layer of the onion. In fact, what we now know is that there was that Jack Flynn was exonerated. The case was going to be closed. Then Joe Biden brought up the Logan Act, which you mentioned earlier, 1799 law nobody’s ever been prosecuted for. Now, not only was it that. We’ve now learned that there was premeditated fraud on a FISA Court to spy on you as a candidate, you and your transition team, and deep into your presidency. James Comey signed three of the four warrants, but he came to you after he signed the first one in Trump Tower and said … well, again, now we know the bulk of information was Hillary’s dirty Russian disinformation document.
Donald Trump: (19:29)
She paid a lot of money for it.
Sean Hannity: (19:31)
She paid for it. They knew it. They said they had verified it. It turned out to be all untrue. But it ended up for you to be in the country a three year nightmare. My question though is this: I mean, General Flynn lost four years of his life.
Donald Trump: (19:48)
Right.
Sean Hannity: (19:48)
Roger Stone’s supposed to report to jail, and the jury foreperson in his case … Paul Manafort’s case was dead. And many people that work for you paid how much in lawyer’s fees over this lie?
Donald Trump: (20:02)
So, start in reverse order. Paul Manafort, they sent it a book. It looked like he got all sorts of cash. It turned out to be a fraud. What they did to that man … what they did to Paul Manafort. Roger Stone, what they’ve done to Roger Stone because he knew me … he wasn’t on the campaign except the very, very beginning. What they did with Roger Stone, what they did to General Flynn. Then how about Papadopoulos? I didn’t know Papadopoulos. But what they put him through. He turned out to be totally … they had a tape of his conversation. It was supposed to be this conversation was like a perfect conversation.
Donald Trump: (20:34)
They also have a tape of Flynn’s conversation with the Russian ambassador, which is a normal thing to do. You’re going to have that position. You start calling up because you want to coordinate between countries, and the tape was … as you said, with the Russia, with the Ukrainian situation. It was a perfect tape. It was a perfect conversation that he had. What they’ve done to General Flynn … who’s a nice man, tough guy, smart guy, a great general. I’ll tell you, General Milley said he’s one of the finest people. He’s just a good man, Flynn.
Donald Trump: (21:07)
What happened to him, the way they went after him … And if you remember … you remember well. The FBI left. They said he did nothing wrong. They said he didn’t lie. They didn’t say he lied. They said he didn’t lie. They persecuted him.
Sean Hannity: (21:18)
They threatened to put his son and go after his son.
Donald Trump: (21:20)
They said to me, “What was the toughest friends of mine? What’s the toughest country to deal with? Who is it? Is it China? Is it Russia? Could it be North Korea?” I said, “No, it’s the United States of America. The toughest country to deal with.” Because we have Schumer, and Pelosi, and people that are bad people that I honestly believe don’t love our country. What they do to our country, and what they’ve done with this scam … the whole scam. Flynn is a piece of it. The Mueller scam. Now, it came out that Mueller should have announced in the first week that we did nothing wrong. In other words, they had evidence in the first few days that there was no collusion with Russia. There was nothing to do with Russia. They knew that immediately. He didn’t have to take two or two and a half years.
Donald Trump: (22:03)
They knew that immediately. He didn’t have to take two or two and a half years. They knew it immediately. What they’ve put this country through. Jeff Sessions was a disaster. He was a total disaster because he basically let it happen, unknowingly because he’s not very smart, but they let it happen. And it’s a shame what they put this country through.
Sean Hannity: (22:22)
As you look… We now have a Durham report, we now have the Inspector General report. I would imagine there’s probably going to be indictments at the end of this. When you look at the names of the people, for example, the jury foreperson in Roger Stone’s case was prejudiced against… That was not a fair and impartial jury.
Donald Trump: (22:39)
Can you believe it? Can you believe it? The hatred that she had for him and for me. And she said, “Oh no, I don’t know.” She acted like she was an innocent. She ran for Congress or something and lost. But she was pretending to be an innocent. How did she even get into the jury pool? She must have had a little contact. And the judge, who’s been brutal. The judge who sentenced Roger has been brutal. Take a look at what she’s done to people.
Sean Hannity: (23:05)
Same judge in the Manafort case.
Donald Trump: (23:07)
Well, take a look at what she did for Hillary related things, okay? Wasn’t brutal there. But look at what she did to people. Just take a look at what she’s done. And Roger Stone had a jury foreman, forewoman, who was a disaster. How that’s not declared a mistrial or more than a mistrial is incredible to anybody that sees it. This is a person that hated Roger Stone, hated me, and obviously said wonderful things. Otherwise, she couldn’t have gone and-
Sean Hannity: (23:39)
It looks like he reports to jail, I believe in four days. Are you thinking about a pardon for any of them?
Donald Trump: (23:45)
We’re going to see. I don’t want to get into that.
Sean Hannity: (23:47)
Commutation?
Donald Trump: (23:47)
But I think he was treated very unfairly.
Sean Hannity: (23:51)
Clearly.
Donald Trump: (23:51)
Other than he may have been involved very early on, and I’ve known him for a long time, but I’ve known him like everybody in Washington knew him. You have a lot of guys in Washington. He was not involved in the campaign. Maybe a little bit at the very, very beginning, but he wasn’t a part of the campaign. But he’s a professional. They’ve destroyed his life. Totally destroyed his life. What they’ve done to Roger Stone is incredible. And the jury forewoman stands out. And to at least not give him a new trial is inconceivable. And by the way, she was a dominant person. The jurors said she was very dominating in the room. She dominated. He got a tremendously big sentence. You see these guys, they’re burning down buildings, they’re ripping down statues, they’re hurting police. They don’t go to jail. Nothing happens to them. They wanted to give him nine years in jail.
Sean Hannity: (24:48)
Process crime.
Donald Trump: (24:50)
Yeah. If that. If that. And then you have these prosecutors who were Mueller related, the whole Mueller related thing. One friend said to me, “You have to be the most innocent man in the history of the United States.” I had 18 angry Democrat geniuses, all smart, smart as hell. Mueller lost it. But they’re all smart as hell. All these guys were after me. They spent 45, 49, 55, I hear all different numbers, million dollars over a period of two and a half years. And they got nothing on me. I think I am the probably… A friend of mine said, “You have to be the most perfect person.”
Sean Hannity: (25:32)
They had everybody. We’ll take a break. We’ll come back. As we continue from great Green Bay, Wisconsin. Also, the president will be answering your questions as we continue. Stay with us.
Sean Hannity: (25:49)
All right, welcome back. We are in Green Bay, Wisconsin. All right. The audience has some questions for the president. We’re going to start from Linda. Hi Linda from…
Linda: (25:59)
Wausau, Wisconsin.
Sean Hannity: (26:00)
Thank you for being here with us today. Say hello to President Trump.
Donald Trump: (26:03)
Wausau Windows, right? Windows. You know, I bought a lot of Wausau Windows over the years. I shouldn’t give them a free commercial, but they did a good job. It’s a great window.
Linda: (26:12)
They are.
Donald Trump: (26:13)
Wisconsin.
Linda: (26:14)
Love it up here.
Donald Trump: (26:15)
Thank you.
Linda: (26:19)
[foreign language 00:26:16] My Cuban background.
Donald Trump: (26:21)
Good.
Linda: (26:22)
I have a question for you. I appreciate so much what you have done for this country. And I know it’s been tough. What do you think is your greatest accomplishment, in your eyes?
Donald Trump: (26:37)
So a lot of people think it’s the fact that we will have, I think before I’m finished this term, we’ll have close to 300 federal judges. A lot of people think… Because that’s a record. That’s a number that nobody can even believe. And part of it was that President Obama was unable to get judges approved in a large number, about 142 judges. So I took it off, got them approved, and then got a lot approved beyond. So we’ll be close to 302 Supreme Court judges, great ones. And so I think a lot of people would say that.
Donald Trump: (27:07)
I think one of them, though, is our military. We have Space Force, which we’ve added after 76 years, we’ve added a new branch of the military. It’s a big deal, a very important deal, because space is going to be very important. It already is. I would say the rebuilding of the military and the taking care of our vets. We had a 91% joint approval rating the other day. The VA. The VA was a disaster. All of my life, I’ve seen these horror stories. I don’t want to really jinx it, because they’ll go around and find somebody that’s unhappy. But you don’t see that anymore. And our administrator, our secretary, has done a fantastic job. And we’re 91% approval rating with the VA.
Donald Trump: (27:47)
And we got Veterans Choice approved and Veterans Accountability. That’s where you can fire people that do a bad job. You couldn’t do it before. Very hard to get. They tried to get it for 50 years. Because of civil service unions, et cetera, you couldn’t get it. I got it. And the other thing is Veterans Choice, where if they can’t see a doctor, we have great doctors in the VA. But if you can’t see a doctor, you go out and you get a private doctor, we pay the bill. You have no idea how great it’s been. And it’s actually, you save money, believe it or not. But you have no idea. We save lives, tremendous number of lives. And I would say that’s an achievement.
Donald Trump: (28:22)
But we’ve done a lot. The largest tax cuts ever, the largest regular… If you look at our regulation cut, Sean, more than any other administration in history, whether it’s eight years or in one case, more than that, we cut regulations. And we we still have a lot more we’re going to be cutting over the next month and a half, two months. So we’ve done a lot and we’re very proud of it. And we had the best, until this artificial problem, because I call it an artificial problem. We had to turn off our country to save millions of lives, and now we’ve turned it back on, and it’s coming back much faster than anybody thought possible. So we’ve done a lot of things. But it could be judges, could be the military. Thank you.
Linda: (29:03)
Thank you very much.
Sean Hannity: (29:05)
Two questions. Question I get asked most often. The people that love and support you, they want to know why you fight so hard with the media. Why do you fight against them? Why do you com… You take on anybody that goes on. And you answered this, interestingly, in the Martha and Brett town hall. And for those that say, well, maybe you shouldn’t fight on all these issues, what do you say to them?
Donald Trump: (29:32)
I don’t think I have a choice. If I didn’t take on the media, I guarantee I wouldn’t be here with you tonight. I’d be watching on television, maybe I’d be in the crowd, but I’d be watching. I wouldn’t be interviewed. You couldn’t win. And I haven’t, even to this day, every… The New York Times is so dishonest. The Washington Post is so dishonest. They write things… You can do something great and they can make it sound horrible. You can do something good and they can make it sound beyond belief bad, like it’s the worst thing ever. And I said it a little bit before, you can do something great and it doesn’t get reported. That’s, in a way, just as bad, because a lot of people can figure it out.
Donald Trump: (30:15)
The level of dishonesty in the media is… I think they’re the most dishonest people I’ve ever dealt with. Now, not everybody. You’re an honest journalist. You’re a great journalist. We have great journalists. Look at the Pulitzer Prize. The Pulitzer Prize is very embarrassed. It’s lost a lot of its credibility, because all these writers got Pulitzer Prizes on the Russia, Russia, Russia, and they were all wrong. But John Solomon and all of the people that you deal with. And you, by the way. Laura, Lou Dobbs, Fox and Friends, people that are great. Great group in the morning, including the weekends, to be honest, with Pete. You have some great people. But they got Pulitzer Prizes on Russia, Russia, Russia, and they were wrong. Now, a committee should meet-
Sean Hannity: (31:05)
We were right on the deep state. They were wrong. For years, they were wrong for three years.
Donald Trump: (31:09)
No, you were right about everything. You were right on Ukraine. The Ukraine thing was a hoax. It was a pure hoax. Think of it. They impeached a duly elected President of the United States on a perfect conversation. Actually, there were two conversations. The first one was, “Hello, goodbye.” They don’t even talk about that. The second one was about the same thing. They impeached a President of the United States. Now, in all fairness, the Republican Party was great, because they got 196 to nothing Republican votes in the House, and 52 1/2 to 1/2, Romney. Romney. Half of a… I call it 52 1/2 to 1/2, because he had two votes and one was yes. But we did. They were great. The Republican Party was great. They were steadfast because they knew it was a hoax. It was purely a party line impeachment. Nothing like that’s ever happened before.
Sean Hannity: (32:05)
To add to that, they had to ignore Joe on tape saying, “You’re not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor investigating my zero experience on making millions.” But with that said, Jim is with us from beautiful Wisconsin. Hey, Jim.
Jim: (32:20)
Thank you, Sean. Mr. President, welcome to Green Bay, Wisconsin and Northeast Wisconsin.
Donald Trump: (32:25)
Thank you.
Jim: (32:25)
Great to have you with us. My question for you is, with all the unrest we’ve seen across the country, and right here in the state of Wisconsin, last night in our capital city, a Senator was beaten, Lady Forward was ripped off her pedestal, we lost some other statues. What steps is the administration taking to give us back our streets?
Donald Trump: (32:44)
So very strong. You happen to have a Democrat governor right now. If you would have had Governor Walker, that wouldn’t have happened.
Jim: (32:52)
That’s right.
Donald Trump: (32:52)
Wouldn’t have happened. I’m not saying it. If Scott were your governor, that would not have happened. But it did happen and it was a shame. And the person they beat up was a dem-
Donald Trump: (33:03)
And it was a shame. The person they beat up was a Democrat who happened to be gay. He was probably out there rooting them on or something, because Democrats think it’s wonderful that they’re destroying our country. It’s a very sick thing going on. Nobody’s ever seen it.
Donald Trump: (33:16)
Biden is going to be… Look, I don’t think Biden’s a radical left, but it doesn’t matter, because they’re going to just do whatever they want to do. They’ll take him over. He can’t perform. He’s not going to be able to perform. He’s shot. He’s shot. Whether you like it or not, he’s shot. The radical left is going to take him over. Look what happened. Eliot Engel was a pretty main line guy. He lost by like 37 points or so. He just got killed in the election we just had yesterday.
Donald Trump: (33:45)
He was supposed to be a shoo-in, and he got hit by a strong far left candidate. You have a couple of other Congressmen and women that probably are going to lose, or are going to lose, very close. Too close to call. Look at what’s happened to the Democrats, and these are real lefties. These are people that… Take a look at Venezuela. Venezuela was a very rich country, a great country, a beacon 20 years ago, 15 years ago. People looked… Richest country in Latin South America. Richest, everything good. They don’t have food. They don’t have water. They have death all over. People have nothing.
Donald Trump: (34:27)
It’s the same exact mindset and philosophy that we have today on attack, and it won’t happen. Not while I’m here, it won’t happen. But a guy like Biden, he’s going to have no power to do anything about it. And they’re dragging him. I don’t know if you saw, Bernie Sanders said, “My sole focus now is to take Joe Biden way left.” They’re going to do it, because there’s nobody in the center left. He was left anyway, but there’s nobody in the center or center left.
Donald Trump: (34:56)
I mean, it’s a disgrace what’s happened to our country. Now, with that being said, the Republicans have to get tougher. And I’m telling them all the time, because they’re sitting back, they want to be politically correct. They think, “Oh, it’s terrible to say something bad.” No, no, no. I told them. You’ll see, if anyone attacks… I stopped it the other night, I stopped it a number of times, but you’ll see what’s happening. We told him, every night we’re going to get tougher and tougher. At some point, there’s going to be retribution, because there has to be. These people have vandals, but they’re agitators, but they’re really terrorists, in a sense.
Donald Trump: (35:33)
So I think you’ll be extremely impressed, but you have to put pressure. Also, I love the Republicans. I told you, they came from me a hundred percent. I’m at 96% approval rating in the Republican party. But I said, “You’re going to have to get tougher. You can’t be politically correct anymore, because we’re really fighting something that’s very dangerous.” Thank you.
Speaker 1: (35:53)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Sean Hannity: (35:55)
Let’s talk about a second term. If you hear in 131 days from now, at some point in the night or early morning, we can now project Donald J. Trump has been reelected the 45th president of the United States. Let’s talk. What’s at stake in this election as you compare and contrast, and what is one of your top priority items for a second term?
Donald Trump: (36:17)
Well, one of the things that will be really great… You know, the word experience is still good. I always say talent is more important than experience. I’ve always said that, but the word experience is a very important word. It’s a very important meeting. I never did this before. I never slept over in Washington. I was in Washington, I think, 17 times. All of a sudden, I’m president of the United States. You know the story. I’m riding down Pennsylvania Avenue with our First Lady and I say, “This is great.”
Donald Trump: (36:43)
But I didn’t know very many people in Washington, it wasn’t my thing. I was from Manhattan from New York. Now I know everybody, and I have great people in the administration. You make some mistakes. An idiot like Bolton, all he wanted to do is drop bombs on everybody. You don’t have to drop bums on everybody. You don’t have to kill people. [ crosstalk 00:37:01]-
Sean Hannity: (37:01)
If John Bolton, in fact, released classified material. Should he be prosecuted?
Donald Trump: (37:06)
Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Well, he did release classified. Actually, he had a… A judge said that they released the book early, so he couldn’t do it.
Sean Hannity: (37:14)
Yeah, so they couldn’t stop it.
Donald Trump: (37:14)
But he said, “This is very dangerous, what you’ve done for yourself. And also, any money that you’ve made, good luck.” This was a very powerful opinion that we had. No. He’s sort of a sick guy. There’s something wrong with him. But I noticed that earlier, he made two very bad mistakes. He made a mistake where he talked about the Libyan model. I won’t go to explain that, but some of you understand, he was on Deface the Nation. And he talked about the Libyan model. I said, “That’s a disaster,” because you know why.
Donald Trump: (37:45)
And the other thing he said, “Going into Iraq was a good thing.” I said, “Okay, John, but now you know it wasn’t, right?” “No, no. I still think it was.” I said, “So we’re in for $8 trillion in the Middle East, and you think that was a good thing?” And I’m pulling out, you know, I’ve getting everybody out nice and easy. Everyone’s going nicely. Going nicely. “You think it was good to go into Iraq, go into the Middle East?”
Donald Trump: (38:10)
“Yes.” So those two things happened early in his little period of time. He was only there a short while. Once he said those two things, I no longer paid much attention to him, if any. But I’ll tell you, he was good for one thing. Everyone thought he was crazy, because all he wants to do is bomb people. You know, he’ll fight Russia. Let’s fight Russia. Let’s fight China. Let’s take them on at the same time. He’s crazy. When I walked into a room with him, I knew that. When they saw Bolton, they always gave me what I wanted, because they said, “Trump’s going to drop bombs on me. He’s got this maniac with him.”
Donald Trump: (38:42)
So in a way, he helped me in terms of a negotiation. But seriously, he didn’t do a good job. He wasn’t smart. He wasn’t sharp. And he’s the only man I think I’ve ever met… I knew him for a year, one year, whatever the time was, short time. I don’t think I ever saw him smile once. I said to him once, “John, do you have a smile?” And it tells you something about somebody.
Sean Hannity: (39:04)
You still beat back the caliphate. You got Baghdadi and associates, you got Soleimani. You got the al Qaeda leader in Yemen.
Donald Trump: (39:11)
We’ve done a lot, we’ve done a lot. We took out Soleimani, number one heroist in the world. We took out al-Baghdadi. He was also considered number one. I guess they fought for number one, I got them both. Obama should have gotten al-Baghdadi, but we took them both out.
Sean Hannity: (39:25)
And the caliphate.
Donald Trump: (39:26)
We took a hundred percent of the caliphate. When I took it over, it was all over the place. It was a disaster. That’s the ISIS caliphate.
Sean Hannity: (39:32)
It won’t be on your second term agenda to drop cargo planes of cash for mullahs in Iran, I’m just guessing.
Donald Trump: (39:40)
I got 1.8 billion in green, beautiful cash. But in cash, 1.8 billion, I think it was five plane loads of cash. Five plane loads.
Sean Hannity: (39:48)
Cargo.
Donald Trump: (39:49)
1.8 billion and 150 billion. Actually, I was more impressed with 1.8 billion in cash, if you want to know that truth. So it was one of those things.
Sean Hannity: (39:56)
Mark, Wisconsin. Hey Mark, how are you?
Donald Trump: (39:58)
Hi Mark.
Mark: (39:59)
Doing well. Looking forward to your second-
Donald Trump: (40:02)
He looks like Bolton, but a better looking version. Look at him.
Mark: (40:06)
I could do the same-
Donald Trump: (40:07)
Much better looking.
Mark: (40:07)
I could do a better job, I think.
Donald Trump: (40:08)
I don’t think he likes it.
Mark: (40:10)
Looking forward to your second term.
Donald Trump: (40:13)
Thank you.
Mark: (40:13)
The big concern I’ve got is, how are you going to make sure that the election is fair and free from fraudulent “absentee votes” and mail-in ballots? That’s the concern I’ve got.
Donald Trump: (40:25)
I think it’s the most important question I’ll be asked, because it’s a great question. Now we have a mail-in thing. As you see California, he’s sending out millions and millions of ballots. Where are they going? Where aren’t they going? Is the postman going to hand them out? Are they going to take them out of the mailboxes?
Donald Trump: (40:42)
The other thing, Mark, it’s very important. You get to foreign countries. You know, they keep talking, oh, Russia, China, this. Especially China, not Russia, especially China. Are they going to print millions of ballots using the exact same paper, using the exact same machines, and are they going to print ballots, and then hand them in? And all of a sudden, it’s the biggest risk we have: the mail-in ballot. Not so much the absentee ballot, because an absentee, like I’m in the White House, and I have to vote in Florida, et cetera, et cetera. You’re absentee, it’s okay.
Donald Trump: (41:14)
But people go through a process for that. You know, it’s really pretty good. But the mail-in ballots, they mail them to anybody, and they send them out by the millions. I think I read over 30 million ballots are going to be sent out in California. Where are they going? Nobody’s standing there watching you vote. At least the other way, you get in line, and they’re using… You know, I said the other day. We went through World War I and we voted. We went through World War II and we voted, and now we have a virus. By that time, it’ll be less and less. Why aren’t we going to vote? People want to vote, but it would be nice to be able to see the people. On top of that, they should have ID voting.
Mark: (41:53)
Absolutely.
Donald Trump: (41:53)
Okay. We should have ID ballots.
Mark: (41:55)
Absolutely.
Sean Hannity: (41:57)
Great question. You’ve said you would like to have more than three debates with Joe Biden.
Donald Trump: (42:03)
I said I’ll have three, and any amount they want. I didn’t say I want more. See, if you say you want more, just to show what a tricky business is. I want more. They’ll say, “Oh, he feels he’s losing. He wants more,” so I don’t like to say that. I will do whatever number they want to do. That’s okay with me three.
Sean Hannity: (42:19)
But a minimum of three.
Donald Trump: (42:20)
Yeah, I guess the three is the minimum. Now, he’s already saying that he can’t do the debates because of COVID. You believe it? “I can’t do the debates because of COVID.” I just heard a little inkling of it two days ago. I said, “Watch this one.” Now, I will do any amount of debates. You understand what I mean? If I say, “I want to do 10 debates,” they’ll say, “Oh, he’s afraid. He’s afraid he’s going to lose.”
Donald Trump: (42:40)
No, no. What I want to do is, I’ll do the three, and I’ll do any amount that they want. It doesn’t make any difference to me. He is a candidate that will destroy this country, and he may not do it himself. He will be run by a radical fringe group of lunatics that will destroy our country. And people have to know that."
"Jun 24, 2020","President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Duda of Poland, who has done an incredible job. And I do believe he has an election coming up, and I do believe he’ll be very successful. So thank you very much. And all of your representatives, thank you very much for being here. This is the third time that we’ve hosted President Duda. The First Lady and I also cherish our remarkable visit to Poland three years ago. That was an amazing event. We had an event, because it was a speech, and a lot of people watched that speech. But it was a very historic moment, and an important moment for our two countries.
President Donald Trump: (00:34)
The American and Polish people enjoy one of the world’s oldest, strongest, and most enduring friendships. Polish patriots battled by our side to secure American independence. American and Polish warriors fought and died together to defeat the Nazis in World War II. The United States stood shoulder to shoulder with Poland in its courageous struggle against communist oppression.
President Donald Trump: (00:59)
Our bond has been forged in battle, sealed in blood, and strengthened by our shared cultural values. The United States and Poland are united by our firm conviction. That Western civilization has advanced, really and very much advanced I think I have to add, the cause of human progress beyond measure. And that it must be strongly defended, and will at all times be strongly defended. And we will defend it together.
President Donald Trump: (01:29)
In our meeting today, President Duda and I reaffirmed the vital alliance between our nations. Last year, we signed two joint declarations to increase our security collaboration. And we look forward to signing a defense cooperation agreement. Poland recently purchased 32 brand new, state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets. The best in the world. And Poland is one of only eight NATO members… The others, some of them haven’t done so well in terms of what they’re supposed to be paying to NATO. I tell them all the time. And we’ve gotten them up a lot, but not enough. But Poland is one of only eight that is current with the money that they are supposed to be paying. That’s the two percent. Two percent is very low number. But we have a large number of countries that haven’t paid. They’re delinquent. Let’s put it that way. They’re delinquent with respect to their dues, the money they’re supposed to be paying for defense. So the United States is defending a lot of countries. They’re delinquent on what they’re supposed to be paying. And I never feel too good about that.
President Donald Trump: (02:38)
But I will say, I spoke with the Secretary General. And he said we’ve done a great job. But I said we haven’t done good enough. We haven’t done a good enough job. We have secured though, over $400 billion in new pledged defense spending from NATO members, which is something that no other administration has come even close to. I would say they were off by many hundreds of billions of dollars, something the newspaper doesn’t like writing about, that the media doesn’t like talking about. But we will be only satisfied when all members are paying their fair share. Again, only eight members, plus the United States is paying what is considered a fair share.
President Donald Trump: (03:21)
I also applaud Poland and the Polish people for its devotion to safeguarding their country’s borders, very strong borders. And I just left our border, by the way. The wall is moving along rapidly. And our border is about as strong as it’s ever been, our southern border. Last year, we were able to add Poland to the visa waiver program. And they wanted that very badly. And we gave it to them because they really deserve it. It’s a testament to Poland’s vigilant efforts to uphold the rule of law.
President Donald Trump: (03:52)
The United States and Poland have recently signed several longterm contracts for US liquefied natural gas, they’re a big purchaser of our energy, to enhance Poland’s energy security. And we’re working to conclude an agreement that would facilitate Poland’s development of nuclear energy plants. Throughout the purchase they are going to be purchasing with one of our very big, very good companies, technology to do civilian nuclear energy.
President Donald Trump: (04:26)
I want to congratulate Poland for its leadership in the Three Seas Initiative, a crucial energy partnership that will provide a reliable source of energy for Eastern Europe. And it will be free from the threat of foreign extortion. Poland understands foreign extortion very well. The Three Seas Initiative relies on fairness, transparency, and mutual benefit. Our nations have also collaborated on protecting our critical infrastructure and technology. That’s why we’ve signed a 5G joint declaration. And Poland is leading the way in Europe by using trusted providers, and provider equipment, and supply chains for its 5G network. And we’re working along with them, and they using our companies.
President Donald Trump: (05:14)
The United States and Poland cooperate across the truly wide range of fronts that we’re both very much involved in. Here today, is the head of a Polish medical team, very advanced team, very brilliant team fighting the coronavirus alongside of American doctors, Captain Siewiera. Captain. Thank you very much for being here, captain. And we’re making great progress. I hear we’re making great progress, and we’re working together. But we are making great progress on therapeutics and vaccines. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being here.
President Donald Trump: (05:51)
The American and Polish people have been true friends and trusted partners for almost 250 years. We’re forever united by our shared belief in family, faith, law, liberty, democracy, and justice. As the old Polish motto goes, we will stand together in the name of God for our freedom and for yours.
President Donald Trump: (06:13)
President Duda, let me express once again, our gratitude for your visit and friendship. We have had a very special relationship. Our alliance is powerful, and a very powerful testament to what free people can achieve together. And I believe that the greatness of our relationship lies ahead. Thank you very much. President, please. Thank you.
President Duda: (06:38)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. [foreign language 00:06:39].
President Duda (Interpreter): (06:41)
Ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, I’d like to thank very warmly to President Donald Trump, to the President of the United States of America. Thank you very much for inviting me here to Washington, to the White House, to take part in this very important meeting to us. This meeting is important for many reasons. To me, as President of the Republic of Poland, this meetings is important because Poland is the first country after the coronavirus pandemic, which has been invited to the meeting in the White House to discuss the most important matters concerning the future, concerning how the relations will look between the United States and Poland in terms of economy, what those relations will be like in the military sphere, and what those relations will be like in the sphere of health protection. All those elements which are of key importance today.
President Duda (Interpreter): (07:35)
A very big part of our discussions today with Mr. President and our collaborators, were dedicated to the coronavirus, to what the situation looks like in Europe, and on the global stage as concerns the fight against the coronavirus, also in the United States. But first and foremost, we’re also thinking about what measures to take in the future. But first and foremost, thank you so much Mr. President for your declaration that we are going to cooperate, that also our scientists are going to cooperate and collaborate on conducting research concerning the vaccine, and therapy drug against coronavirus. Everything that will be conducive to fighting the coronavirus.
President Duda (Interpreter): (08:16)
So I do believe thanks to this collaboration, those therapeutical medicines will be available also for Poles, for my compatriots as soon as possible. Thank you so much President for that. Because all of us know very well, how high level of medical research is in the United States. And this declaration and the will of cooperation on part of the United States, on part of the President of the United States is of crucial importance to us. So thank you very much for that.
President Duda (Interpreter): (08:40)
But ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed the cooperation in the sphere of economy and military. And let me first mention our economic operation. As the president has just mentioned, we are developing it both in the sphere of energy in building energy security. Today we can say that the United States is cooperating in the sphere of creating energy security. Not only the energy security of Poland, but also the energy security of Central Europe.
President Duda (Interpreter): (09:06)
The president has just mentioned the Three Seas Initiative. Yes, all the investments that are being carried out in Poland today. The extension of the capacity of LNG terminal Świnoujście. We’re increasing its capacity by 2.5 billion cubic meters. We also plan to construct another LNG terminal in the port of Gdansk. All of that is conducive to being able to receive LNG gas, and provide its deliveries not only across Poland, but also for the countries of Central Europe. The vast majority of those countries of Central Europe are still dependent on Russia. And creating a true alternative. In other words, diversification of supplies is of key importance for their security.
President Duda (Interpreter): (09:45)
Thank you, Mr. President, for this cooperation. I do believe that we’re going to further develop it. Today we have got those supplies guaranteed until 2023, by the end of 2023. But I know that we are also going to enter into further contracts in that respect. Even more so that for sure, our demand is going to in
President Duda (Interpreter): (10:03)
Even more so that for sure our demand is going to increase. But, ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed conventional energy and nuclear energy cooperation. In the nearest future, an agreement will be signed between the governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Poland. Thanks to this agreement, we’ll be able to start designing the large design of introducing conventional nuclear energy for the production of electricity in Poland. The entities which will participate in this project have already been selected, and the agreements are very advanced on the Polish side. We have got Minister Piotr Naimski, who is in charge of those negotiations right now, and the appropriate intergovernmental agreement is about to be concluded and finalized. We can expect that to happen in the near future. But ladies and gentlemen, I also want to mention the contribution of the United States into the 3Cs initiative. And first and foremost, the financial contribution to fund of the 3Cs initiative.
President Duda (Interpreter): (11:01)
Mr. President got interested in that fund sometime ago. This is an element, an vehicle which enables the development of this corporation. Thank you, Mr. President for your activity. And thank you for appreciating this cooperation, which takes place in central Europe within the framework of the European Union. And the goal of this collaboration is to develop, to extend the infrastructure. Thank you for noticing the possibility of developing cooperation in the transatlantic zone between the countries of the European Union and the United States. And of course from my point of view, this cooperation with Poland is extremely important to me, but also in the economic sphere where it’s speaking about increasing military cooperation between Poland and the United States, it is also of primary importance. I have no doubts whatsoever that this cooperation will lead to the strengthening of security of the European Union strengthening the security of the Eastern flank of NATO, but also, and perhaps first and foremost, from my perspective, it will strengthen the security of Poland, and it will also land additional financial credibility to Poland, investment credibility on part of American investors.
President Duda (Interpreter): (12:05)
One month ago, a global company, Microsoft announced that they’re going to invest $1 billion in Poland to establish a state of the art data center. And today officially, Google company published the information that is also going to invest in the center of modern technologies in Poland, including IT technologies. This is going to be an even greater investment than investment of Microsoft. So Mr. President, I have no doubts whatsoever that these American investments and this additional investment impulse that the American companies are making right now, results from a very efficient policy that we are conducting together and which increases the sense of safety of our citizens in Poland. And it also increases that sense of safe investments in our country. Thank you so much for that, because that means the creation of new jobs in the state of the art branch of industry IT technologies.
President Duda (Interpreter): (12:58)
And I’m really pleased because in Poland, we have got a large number of excellent, young IT experts also young IT engineers. And for sure we’re able to come to terms with these very serious challenges. Also, as far as intellectual capital is concerned, I’m sure that these investments are going to be beneficial for the United States, for the US companies and also for Poland through creating jobs, through requiring new experiences by young people in a first place by young engineers. I’m also glad Mr. President, because as we said before, the agreements that we entered into concerning increased US military persons in Poland, the agreements we signed last year, according to the first one, the US force is going to be increased by 1000 troops in our country and another, a contract and other agreements stipulated concrete locations in which US soldiers will be stationed in Poland on the rotational basis.
President Duda (Interpreter): (13:55)
But also it’s going to be a heel to toe rotation. Today, we are entering another stage. Namely there is a possibility of further increase in American troops in our country. In recent days, I also talked to secretary general of NATO. I talked to Mr. Ian Stoltenberg, and we agreed on one point, especially as Europeans, we have no doubts whatsoever that if any part of the US armed forces, which is the biggest armed forces in the world was withdrawn from Europe, that would be very detrimental to European security. So we believe it is deeply justified to ensure that the US troops are left in Europe. So Mr. President, thank you so much for listening today. Thank you so much for accepting Poland during this meeting at the white house, we are the first country which has been received after this long break in international diplomacy.
President Duda (Interpreter): (14:53)
Thank you for your words about our pride and heroes of Poles over history today, Polish soldiers stand arm-in-arm with US soldiers. We are tested allies together with appealed obliged in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we stand ready, always ready to implement our allied obligations and commitment. And thank you that the United States, thanks to your policy, Mr. President is demonstrating itself as an absolutely loyal ally to us. And thank you that we can count on the United States. Also I’d like to say that I’m grateful Mr. President, that you have been stressing historical truths in such a decisive way. This is extremely important to us, Poles finding disinformation, defending historical truth. Also about the second world war about who started the war, about the course of the war is incredibly important to us. And thank you, Mr. President, that you are adopting this stance and contributing so much to putting the record straight.
President Duda (Interpreter): (15:56)
It’s important also to us, from the point of view of our dignity, the second world war was a period of great drama and trauma in the history of our nation, we lost 5 million citizens, and that was a tragedy to us. So because of that, it is important to spread this truth to present it as it really was. But it’s also important to speak about the heroism of Poles, wherever they were fighting, wherever they were spilling their blood arm-in-arm with their allies at Monte Casino at Tobruk and at other places all over the world. Both on the eastern front and on the western front, all of that saying that is extremely important. So I’m happy that today we can [inaudible 00:16:37] our security in the United States. I’m glad that we have got this excellent economic corporation. So Mr. President, I have no doubt whatsoever that the coronavirus pandemic will pass and we will be going together towards the development of our countries, towards the development of our societies, towards the building of a better, more prosperous future, both for the United States, for Poland and for Europe. Thank you so much.
President Donald Trump: (17:02)
Ask one to me and one to the President, and that would be great. Steve Holland, go ahead.
Steve Holland: (17:15)
Poland, would you send them from Germany and what sort of signal would that send to Russia? And for President Duda, how do you feel about this? Taking some troops out of Germany to go to Poland? And what signal does that send to Russia? Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (17:32)
Well, just to start, as you know, Poland as I’ve said, many times, Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO, the particular, their monetary obligations. And they asked us if we would send some additional troops, they’re going to pay for that. There’ll be paying for the sending of additional troops and we’ll probably be moving them from Germany to Poland. We’re going to be reducing Germany very substantially down to about 25,000 troops. We actually had 52,000, but we’ll be moving it down to about 25,000.
President Donald Trump: (18:07)
Germany’s paying a very small fraction of what they’re supposed to be paying. They should be paying 2% and they’re paying a little bit more than 1%, depending on how you calculate. You could also calculate that they’re paying less than 1%, but if you assume that paying 1%, that’s a tremendous delinquency. Let’s use that word, delinquency. So we’re going to be reducing our forces in Germany. Some will be coming home and some will be going to other places, but Poland would be one of those other places, other places in Europe.
Steve Holland: (18:41)
Send to Russia by doing this?
President Donald Trump: (18:43)
I think it sends a very strong signal to Russia, but I think a stronger signal sent to Russia is the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia and through the pipeline. And I’m saying, “What’s that all about? You’re spending billions of dollars to Russia then we’re supposed to defend you from Russia?” So I think it’s a very bad, I think the people of Germany are very unhappy about it. I have many friends from Germany and the people in Germany are very unhappy about it. They don’t like it, but that’s what they chose to do. So they’re spending billions of dollars to buy Russian energy and then we’re supposed to defend them from Russia.
President Donald Trump: (19:18)
So that doesn’t work too well. But Poland has been very, very terrific. In fact, I don’t believe Poland is actually accepting any of the energy from the pipeline from Russia. So that sends a signal right there. With all of that being said, we expect to get along with Russia. We expect to get along with everybody, but Germany, they really owe a lot of money in NATO. And this has been going on for many years. When you add it all up, you’re probably getting close to a trillion dollars and that’s not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn’t treating the United States fairly. You know, the United States is a very, is the major participant in NATO. We pay more than anybody else by far, have for many, many years. So we defend Europe.
President Donald Trump: (20:03)
Anybody else by far have for many, many years. So we defend Europe, but Europe also takes tremendous advantage of the United States on trade. Advantage like you wouldn’t believe. So we’re trying to work that out. And I would imagine they’d like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than President Trump. But after the election, they’ll just have to pay more. But that’s the way it is. Okay? Thank you very much. Please.
Speaker 1: (20:27)
[inaudible 00:00:28].
President Duda (Interpreter): (20:28)
Sir, first of all, I do respect very much both Mr. President Donald Trump and the United States of America. A wonderful, great state, which today is the largest military and economic superpower in the world. And I wouldn’t dare say to the President of the United States of America where he should send his soldiers, because this is the decision which is always taken by the United States. This is a very responsible decision. However, I do not deny that I requested Mr. President that he would not withdraw US forces from Europe because the security of Europe is very important to me. From Europe as such, I’m talking about the United Europe, for which the American persons, since the end of the second world war is a huge security guarantee. However, if I’m asked by anybody if I am ready, that Poland receives more US troops in our country, of course I am ready. In 2014, Russia attacked Ukraine, it annexed Crimea, it occupies Luhansk and Donetsk. Before that, it had attacked Georgia. 2014 was a year of huge fears, huge fears, the Baltic States, and very big ones, very considerable ones among the Polish society.
President Duda (Interpreter): (21:48)
Today, the presence of native troops and first and foremost of US troops in Poland demonstrates that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is treated seriously. And it shows that if anyone wanted to attack Poland, it won’t be a soft landing for that entity. That won’t pay off for such an aggressor because the strongest army of the world is present and they would help Polish soldiers to defend our borders if such a case arises. 100 years ago, we repelled Russians from Warsaw. In a great battle in 1920, we defeated the [inaudible 00:22:23] army Bolsheviks and we drove them back to the east. That was a great victory, but we managed to stop them only very near to war. So at the outskirts of our capital city, we would never want to see that situation repeated again. That is why the [inaudible 00:22:38] presence is crucially important to us today and it is a very important security guarantee to us.
President Duda (Interpreter): (22:43)
So I’m very pleased that both within NATO, as well as in the United States and today, that President of the United States understands the history of Europe and he understands the realities in Europe, and that he also understands the situation as it is developing in Europe. So today, this generates peace to my country, it brings security. And thanks to that, Russia, unfortunately, the very strong Imperial ambitions, which have been revived over the last tens of years, I can say, because Georgia was attacked in 2008, thanks to this, those ambitions have been stopped for the time being, at least in this part of the world. And I have no doubt whatsoever that this is also a huge merit of the policy of the United States. I’m grateful for that just like all my compatriots are.
President Donald Trump: (23:30)
I want to add 2014, which the President was talking about, that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us. Hasn’t happened with us. And it won’t happen with us either. Please go ahead.
Speaker 1: (23:56)
[foreign language 00:24:02]
President Duda (Interpreter): (24:00)
[foreign language 00:00:24:04].
Speaker 2: (24:01)
President, you had to cancel your last trip, your last visit to Poland because of the hurricane. Are you planning a new visit to Poland in the near future? And the second question is on COVID. Is there a chance for Poland to participate in the development and early access, both to the vaccine and to the therapeutics? [foreign language 00:04:21].
President Duda (Interpreter): (24:21)
Mr. President, is there a chance that during this cooperation with the United States we’ll get an fast access, both to the vaccine as well as to concrete drugs against coronavirus?
President Donald Trump: (24:36)
And we’d like to do it again, as soon as we can. We have an election happening in this country, as you probably have heard. And so I probably won’t be able to do it until after the election. But assuming things go well, the answer is a very definite yes, actually. As far as the joining with us on the vaccines and therapeutics, by the way, because the therapeutics to me, if you gave me a choice right now, probably therapeutically, maybe I’d like that even better, but we’re working very well on both. I think we’re coming up with some great answers. I think you’re going to have a big surprise, a beautiful surprise, sooner than anybody would think. But the answer is yes, we will be getting Poland involved, both in terms of helping, but also in terms of taking care of the Polish people once we have the vaccine. But I think we’re going to have it very soon. Okay? Thank you.
Speaker 1: (25:25)
[foreign language 00:25:27].
President Duda (Interpreter): (25:28)
Sir, we got involved as a state in the cooperation and also in supporting allies, be it in a symbolic dimension, of the United States in the fight against coronavirus. That is why we have here with us today a Captain medical doctor from Poland. I want to say yes, of course. I’m working on this obvious assumption that by taking part in the research and also by being, in a certain sense, co-creators of the vaccines and therapeutics, Poles will be able to count on these vaccines and therapeutics to be available for it at Poles as soon as possible. So speaking openly, this is also the intention I have in my cooperation with the United States of America, to make sure that these vaccines are available to Poles and to other nations, wherever they will be applied as soon as possible.
President Donald Trump: (26:22)
Okay. Thank you very much. John, please.
John: (26:25)
Thank you, Mr. President. This afternoon, the bill on reform in the Senate failed to move forward. It may still see the light of day at some point, but at the moment, it’s stalled in the Senate. As well, you have an executive order that is coming out later on this week regarding monuments and what to do about people who deface or damage these monuments. Could you tell us what you’re planning to do in the executive order and your reaction to what happened in the Senate?
President Donald Trump: (26:55)
Well, the Senate Republicans want very much to pass a bill on police reform. We have total cooperation with many different communities, including the police community. They want it very much to happen themselves because there are things that they agree to, that they would like to agree to, and they would love to have it agreed to formally. The Democrats don’t want to do it because they want to weaken our police, they want to take away immunity, they want to do other things that you know about as well as anybody in this beautiful field that we set. They want to take away a lot of the strength from our police and from law enforcement generally. And we can’t live with that. We can’t live with it. This is a great bill, strongly endorsed by, as you know, Tim Scott, who’s terrific, who is a terrific man, great Senator, South Carolina. And Mitch wants it to happen, I would like to see it happen. But we won’t sacrifice, we won’t do that. We won’t do anything that’s going to hurt our police.
President Donald Trump: (28:01)
The police, we have a record this year on crime, a record positive rating on crime this year, the best. And you hear about certain places like Chicago, and you hear about what’s going on in Detroit and other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. 20 out of 20. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run. We have one city or two cities in particular, worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan, worse than Afghanistan. And these are cities within the United States. Democrat run, radical left run. You see what’s going on in Seattle, you see what’s going on in other places. Seattle, of all places, who would even think that’s possible? 20 out of 20. The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement and our police. And frankly, they want to defund largely, at least largely. There are some that want to defund and abolish our police, if you can believe that. And we’re not letting that happen. So if nothing happens with it, it’s one of those things. We have different philosophies. They want open borders, they want sanctuary cities, we don’t.
President Donald Trump: (29:13)
As far as your number, your second question, I think that we’re going to have a very strong executive order, but we already have very strong. We have the monuments act already, which means 10 years in jail. But I think we’re going to consolidate various things. We’re going to come out with a very strong executive order. And I should have that by the end of the week, which is fast approaching. We’re going to have a very, very, very powerful statement. We’ve arrested numerous people, as you know, for what took place outside of Washington. In addition, the FBI is investigating hundreds of people throughout the country for what they’ve done to monument statues and even buildings. So we have very strong laws already on the books and we have a law that’s 10 years. It’s 10 years. That’s a long time. To have fun one-
President Donald Trump: (30:03)
…years. It’s 10 years, that’s a long time, to have fun one night. I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don’t even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is. When they knocked down Grant, when they want to knock down Grant, but when they look at certain… Now they’re looking at Jesus Christ, they’re looking at George Washington, they’re looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson: not going to happen, not going to happen. Not as long as I’m here.
President Donald Trump: (30:31)
As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we’re going to have a very strong executive order and it’ll happen very quickly before the end of the week.
John: (30:48)
We have an election coming up in November. You have an election coming up on Sunday. Some of your critics who are politicians here in the United States have criticized this visit to the White House saying it is tantamount to election interference because it shows a very close relationship between the United States and Poland at a time when you really need it. What do you say to those critics? And Mr. President, feel free to weigh in if you want to.
President Duda: (31:13)
[foreign language 00:31:14].
President Duda (Interpreter): (31:16)
So first of all, let me also followup on the question that you asked to President Donald Trump. I’d like to thank you, Mr. President, because among others not a long time ago the monument to General Kosciuszko was devastated. That was the national hero of Poland but also the national hero of the United States who was fighting for the independence of the United States. He had great merits and he was also the commander of a Polish uprising where he was fighting for the independence of Poland. He suffered heavy wounds in Poland, fighting for the independence of our country and for completely incomprehensible reasons to us, that monument was devastated recently. And thank you so much that it has been renewed so fast and that made it possible for me to lay flowers at that monument and pay tribute to a great soldier and a great commander.
President Duda (Interpreter): (32:13)
Thank you for that. That was outrageous for a big number of Polish people back in Poland, all of them probably, and for many, many Polish people living here also in the United States. Polish organizations here in the United States asked me and told me that they would renew that monument. I know that it has already been renewed by the United States, no assistance was needed. So I’m very grateful for that, that here, the monumental of Kosciuszko tends near the White House and who looks as he should look, which he has deserved for the merits he laid for the United States and for Poland. So thank you very much for that, Mr. President.
President Duda (Interpreter): (32:48)
And answering to your question, two months ago, at the very beginning of the pandemic of coronavirus, we had a lengthy conversation with President Donald Trump. The pandemic disrupted the plans of our corporation, which we had. And back then we made an arrangement with Mr. President that we would meet as soon as it would be possible. And this has been implemented. And the fact that this arrangement has been put into force is demonstrated by the visit today. I’m very grateful to Mr. President for inviting me here today and together with Mr. President, we are implementing our presidential duties.
President Duda (Interpreter): (33:23)
The president is always in charge of his national interests and this is the task of the president. When the president is acting in the international sphere, this is my sense and I also know that also it is a very strong belief of President Donald Trump, the president is supposed to realize the interest of their country. So Mr. President Trump is realizing the interest of his own country and I’m realizing the interest of Poland. So we are looking for a win, win situation where both parties are the winners, where both parties are able to implement their interests as part of the cooperation which we are implementing. This is the way we act. And in this very moment, we are acting on a national level and the state level. We are just fulfilling our obligations and duties as presidents of our countries, as those who are representing our nations and who want our societies to have as good lives as possible. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (34:10)
He’s doing very well in Poland, he’s doing a terrific job. The people of Poland think the world of him. And, by the way, Mrs. Duda, Who is a terrific woman, terrific woman who we’ve gotten to know also through our various travels and meetings. But they think the world of him and I don’t think he needs my help. I’m honored that this is a day that’s, I guess, just before your election, I’m honored but he will do very well with or without us. He’s going to have a great success and Poland is going to continue on. They’re doing incredibly well as a country. Okay, please. Thank you.
President Duda (Interpreter): (34:47)
Thank you very much Mr. President. Best regards to your wife. [foreign language 00:04:56]

Polish television.
President Duda (Interpreter): (34:57)
Good morning [foreign language 00:00:35:00] Polish television.
Speaker 3: (35:01)
I want to ask about timing of that visit. President Andrzej Duda is the first president, the first international guest in the White House since the lockdown. And today there was a big military parade in Moscow. Can we combine those two facts? Is it proved that Poland is an important partner for America? Can we treat it that we can rely on America and Poland? Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (35:28)
Well, I think you can and we also are working with Russia right now on an arms treaty which is a very big thing, nuclear arms specifically, but we’re working very much and I think I can say, Mike, we’re doing very well on that. We’re two countries that want to see it happen and we’re working on other things with Russia. We have a very good relationship, we have our ambassador over there right now who will be attending certain festivities and that’s a good thing. And I think that’s frankly a good thing for Poland also.
President Donald Trump: (35:58)
Likewise, we’re going to be having very important dignitaries at your parade. You’re going to be having a very big event soon and we’re going to be in August and we’re going to have people representing the United States at a very high level. And that’s very important to us also. Okay. Please.
President Duda: (36:18)
[foreign language 00:36:17].
President Duda (Interpreter): (36:20)
Sir, I have this feeling and sense that I’m conducting negotiations in Polish matters here in very experienced and very tough politician, tough player I can say that is President Donald Trump, who is standing strongly and looking to the interest of his country and he’s citizens. What I’m doing here is I’m representing public industry here and I’m not parading in Moscow. That is all. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (36:47)
Thank you all very much. We will see you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:36:52]"
"Jun 23, 2020","Donald Trump: (02:04)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Ah, go ahead, sit down. We’ll be here for a little while. Sit down. Thank you also, Lee Greenwood, thank you to Lee Greenwood. But I’m thrilled to be in Arizona with thousands of patriotic, young Americans who stand up tall for America and refuse to kneel to the radical left. That’s true. That’s true.
Donald Trump: (02:29)
There is something going on. You feel it right? You feel the spirit. The other night, a speech I made, on Saturday night, at a very good place. And we had a great evening and the ratings came out you saw that, on television. It was the number one show in Fox history for a Saturday night. Number one. Ratings. For them, it’s all about the ratings. I know that the other folks back there, CNN, and MSDNC I know they’re very happy. They’re very happy to see that Fox said the number one show. This is the number one show in the history of Fox News. That’s pretty good. Saturday night.
Donald Trump: (03:19)
Let us also show our appreciation to my good friend. Charlie. I’ll tell you, Charlie is some piece of work. Who is mobilizing a new generation of pro-American student activists. That’s what you are and really smart. And you’ll be up here someday. Somebody in that audience, maybe a few of you. You’re going to be up here. Right here. Who are tough and smart and determined and truly unstoppable. You are. I want to thank also Kimberly and I want to thank my son. Boy, I watched my son. I got here. Wow. I said, “What’s this all about?” He’s good. And the people like him. People like him a lot. To everyone here today and watching live all across our country, Thank you for bravely defending our nation, our values and our great American heroes. You know what’s going on, because you’re on the front lines of a tremendous intellectual struggle for the future of our country. That’s really what you’re talking about. The future of our country. You see what’s happening. It’s a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. If we weren’t here, you could forget it. But we’re going to be here and then you’re going to be here and we’re going to keep it going for a long time.
Donald Trump: (04:46)
November 3rd is a big day. Get out, get the parents, get the friends, get the husband, get the wife, get everybody. Now, the difference is they get everybody. Even if they’re not registered, if they’re not citizens, if they’re here illegally, they get everybody. That’s one of the little difficulties. And , you go through a whole nation and you see what’s going on and they report zero illegality, check out California, sometime.
Donald Trump: (05:19)
No, check out the deal that they signed with Judicial Watch. I think Judicial Watch was 1 million, or 1.5 million people they settled. They agreed that that many people either voted illegally, shouldn’t have been voting, a lot of things. They settled. And Judicial Watch said, “Look, we were so high. What difference did it make? What difference would it make?” No. But they play a very dirty game. You’re fighting against an oppressive left wing ideology that is driven by hate and seeks to purge all dissent. And you understand that. Amazing at that age. You’re young people, generally, a couple of oldsters out there, friends of mine.
Donald Trump: (06:03)
The radical left demands absolute conformity from every professor, researcher, reporter, journalist corporation, entertainer, politician, campus speaker, and private citizen. But we have Charlie and we have our people and our people is stronger. Our people are stronger And our people are smarter and we are the elite. We are the elite. If you haven’t noticed, they said it two weeks ago. I was talking to somebody who says, “Well, you know, the elite.” I said, “What are you talking about the elite? Who’s the elite? They’re the elite?” They’re not the elite. You’re the elite.
Donald Trump: (06:45)
You’re smarter, you’re better looking, have a better future, you know your way around to better. Believe it or not. There’s only one thing they have. They’re more vicious. They are vicious. They are vicious people. Anyone who dissents from their orthodoxy must be punished, canceled, or banished. That includes from television. You see it. But you will not be silenced. And the bottom line, I get interviewed by people and I’m sitting there the other day in the Oval Office. And I didn’t like the tone. And I said, “It’s really nice because I’m here and you’re not.” The Oval Office.
Donald Trump: (07:40)
And I’ve said it before, you’re the courageous warrior standing in the way of what they want to do and their goals and standing up for faith and family, God, country and freedom, freedom. Unbelievable spirit. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. But the radical left, they hate our history. They hate our values and they hate everything we prize as Americans, and we’re right, because our country didn’t grow great with them. It grew great with you and your thought process and your ideology.
Donald Trump: (08:51)
The left wing mob is trying to demolish our heritage so they can replace it with a new repressive regime that they alone control. They’re tearing down statues, desecrating monuments, and purging dissenters. It’s not the behavior of a peaceful political movement. It’s the behavior of totalitarians and tyrants and people that don’t love our country. They don’t love our country. The left is not trying to promote justice, or equality, or lift up the downtrodden. They have one goal, the pursuit of their own political power, for whatever reason, but that’s their goal. That really seems to be their goal. Their goal, or their sickness. And if you give power to people that demolish monuments and attack churches and seize city streets, and set fire to buildings, then nothing is sacred and no one is safe. We stopped them last night. Did you see that? Andrew Jackson. And brought some to jail and others are going to jail. The problem we have is states. They’re weak. Many of the governors, many of the mayors, you see what’s going on. And by the way, just so you understand, it’s all liberal Democrat states. Could you imagine if sleepy Joe ever became president, this country would be a mess. They would rip down everything, everything. Sleepy Joe. And he wouldn’t call the shots. He would have nothing to do with him. “Lock him in the Oval Office. Let’s just do what we want to do.” And today he’s with Obama, President Obama. It only took him, how long, a year and a half to endorse him? What did it take, a year and a half to endorse him? Even after he won, he didn’t endorse him for a long time.
Donald Trump: (11:04)
Then he’s fighting. He’s fighting for sleepy Joe. He really feels strongly about it, so strongly that he was fighting. He wanted everybody to win, but Joe. Joe won. But if you remember in my campaign, he fought harder than crooked Hillary. President Obama fought me harder. He said, “You cannot let him win. You cannot this…” He was all over the place. I said, “This guy’s spending all of his time campaigning against me.” Who won? That’s right. And don’t forget. Don’t forget. I’m only here because of him and Biden. I’m only here because of them, because if they did a good job, we wouldn’t have been here. There would have been no reason. I’m only here because of President Obama and the job he did and sleepy Joe Biden and the job that he didn’t do other than he did a good job for his son. He did a good job for son.
Donald Trump: (12:11)
No, but I’m only here because of them. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be here. People were very unhappy. The fake news doesn’t report it. They were very unhappy. There was tremendous dissent, tremendous anger. A lot of people in this audience, I can tell you. But we’re here today to declare that we will never cave to the left wing and the left wing intolerance. We will never. We will never surrender to mob violence. And we will uphold American freedom, equality, and justice for every citizen of every background, very strong. That’s who we are. That is what we believe. And that is why we must prevail on November 3rd. We have to prevail, get out there. We’re honored to be joined by a great gentleman, a great governor of this state. He won by a lot of votes. And I said to him, “Governor, how am I doing?” He said, “You’re doing really well.” I said, “Good.” Because he knows better than anybody, he really has done a tremendous job as governor. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. Where is Doug? Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And somebody who we need to keep in the Senate. A woman who works very hard. I just got back from something you like, the border wall. Martha McSally. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Martha. We got to get her in. And Mark Kelly, who she’s running against is very weak on China and lots of other things. If between Biden and Kelly and these people they get in, China will own this country and they don’t own us at all.
Donald Trump: (14:19)
We have done great. Before the plague set in, before the plague came over. It came over. We were doing the greatest, we had the greatest economy we ever had, the greatest job numbers we ever had, the greatest of everything. There wasn’t a thing where we weren’t number one. We were beating them and they were having a tough year. 67. It was one of the worst years they had in 67 years and we were doing great. And then they said, “there’s a plague coming over from China. Here it comes.” What a disgrace. What a disgrace. And now you saw last week, the jobs numbers, the biggest ever. You saw the retail sales numbers, the biggest ever. Number one. And we’re going to have a very good third quarter. And interestingly, we’re going to have a good third quarter. And right when those numbers are announced, you have your election, so that’s hopefully a sign from up there. But I think we’re going to do very well.
Donald Trump: (15:19)
And they are trying to do their best to keep the country shut down and closed, because they’d love those numbers not to be good. But there’s not a lot they’re going to be able to do about it. Not a lot. But we want to get Martha in, and I want to thank Martha for being here. Governor, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank you for being such a great friend too, thank you.
Donald Trump: (15:44)
And we also have some of your warriors, great representatives. And they fought with me on the impeachment hoax. One of the great hoaxes, based on a telephone conversation. That was perfect. I’m the only one that got impeached in history. Hopefully will be the only one that got impeached over a perfect telephone call. Perfect, perfect. This was the perfect call. I said, “Wait a minute.” I said, “We don’t need lawyers. Just keep reading.” Thank goodness we had it transcribed. It was very good that we had it… Because you remember Adam Schiff got up and he met up a phony story. He made up a phony story. That’s what they’re all about. I said it before. They’re vicious.
Donald Trump: (16:27)
Paul Gosar. Stand up, Paul. Where’s Paul? Paul, stand up. Paul. Great guy. There’s a man, I spoke to him this morning, Andy Biggs. Andy. Great guy. Thank you, Andy. Freedom Caucus. Now that Mark Meadows is our great chief, he’s our chief. Mark Meadows. By the way, Mark Meadows is here too. Let’s have it for Mark Meadows. Where’s Mark? Mark Meadows. But Andy took over and the Freedom Caucus is doing great. Thank you. Thank you, Andy.
Donald Trump: (17:07)
Somebody I got to know very well during the hoax. Debbie Lesko. She’s great. Actually another one. Oh, there she is. She just stood out on television. It was like she popped. She did great. I said, “You’re so lucky you know me, Debbie”, because she really was one of the people, she stood out. Thank you, Deb. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (17:38)
Another warrior, David Schweikert. David. Thank you. Thank you, David. Thank you. And a man who’s very understated. He just gets it done behind the scenes, never likes to go on television. Never likes talking a lot, but he’s a great Congressman from one of my favorite states, Florida, Matt Gaetz. Matt Gaetz. He keeps it low-key and simple. No, actually he keeps it up and not simple, but he’s great. And he does a fantastic job. Thank you Matt.
Donald Trump: (18:24)
Along with a lot of great people, Arizona Treasurer, Kimberly Yee. Kimberly, thank you. House Speaker, Rusty Bowers. Rusty. Rusty. Thank you rusty. Thank you, Senate President, wow, that’s a big deal. Karen Fann. Thank you. Madam President, how am I doing in Arizona? Okay? She says, “Yes.” She knows. She knows. And Navajo Nation Vice President, Myron Lizer, thank you. I also want to recognize a truly courageous woman. Angel Mom, is a friend of mine too, by the way, one of the first people I met when I announced that I was going to run.
Donald Trump: (19:20)
What she has gone through with illegal immigration, nobody will ever go through. Hopefully nobody ever has to go through. Unfortunately, people will have to do it. But she is one of the first people I met. And she lost a magnificent child to an illegal immigrant. And it’s just a horrible thing. And she’s spent her life. She’s spent the last long period of years fighting and fighting and fighting. And people have gotten to respect her greatly, Mary Ann Mendoza, wherever you might be. Lots of guts. She’s got a lot of guts. And thank you, a very special thank you to Pastor Luke Barnett and the Dream City Church for hosting us. Where is the pastor? Is that the pastor? You’re good looking. Where’s the pastor? I want to see this guy. Oh, he’s good.
Donald Trump: (20:40)
I’ll be here. I’ll get here someday. I’ll be here some Sunday morning. Thank you. Thank you. Great job pastor. I hear great things. Thank you very much. We’re also joined by a man who became such a superstar overnight. I put him there as a little bit of a filler, to be honest, he did a great job. He was the ambassador to Germany. And he was like, I needed somebody to sit warm out a chair. He wore out a chair. He didn’t warm it. He wore it out. Matt Gaetz, he wore out the chair. Richard Grenell. What a guy. Where’s Matt? No. Say hello. You are fantastic. I want a picture of him walking into the DOJ with a big satchel. And I realized what [inaudible 00:21:42] said. He goes to the store, and he’s walking. And he had lots of gold in those satchels. Didn’t he have?
Donald Trump: (21:51)
Because I’ll tell ya. We caught him. Let’s see what happens. But we caught him. Right? We caught him. And a friend of mine that did a great job as the NASA CFO. And you see we’ve totally rebuilt NASA. We’re sending rockets up now for the first time in many years, Jeff DeWit, Jeff DeWit. Jeff, hi. Thank you, Jeff.
Donald Trump: (22:20)
Everyone in this room is bound together by a shared set of moral principles and enduring truths. We believe the United States of America is the greatest and most righteous nation that has ever existed, going to keep it that way. We believe that every citizen has the fundamental right to think, to speak, to live and pray, according to their own conscious. We believe that the beloved heroes of American history should not be torn down by militant mobs, but held up as an example to the world. Now, they’re after George Washington. I said, “What did he do wrong? George Washington?” Thomas Jefferson. We stopped him. They were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial. They couldn’t care less. I think half of them don’t even know who Thomas Jefferson is. How about Ulysses S. Grant? They want the Confederate soldiers, but all of a sudden they go after Grant. But he’s the one that defeated the Confederate soldiers. What’s that all about? How about Gandhi? How about Churchill. You know Churchill, because this is going outside of our country. No, we’ll stop it. Don’t worry. Just don’t worry about it. 10 years is a long to spend in prison.
Donald Trump: (23:47)
Our heroes are not a source of shame. They are an example and something that you can all look up to. A true example of greatness, a point of pride. And we will honor them and cherish them forever. We will cherish them and we have to cherish our past. We have to cherish good, or bad. We have to understand our past. We have to understand our history, because if we don’t know our history, it could all happen again. We have to know our history. We believe in law and order, we support the men and women of law enforcement. And we stand with the citizens in every city and every community and every part of our country, who wish to live in safety, security, dignity, and peace. And we know that American patriots don’t bow down to foreign powers. We don’t back down from left wing bullies, and the only…
Donald Trump: (25:03)
From left wing bullies, and the only authority we worship is our God. These are the values our country was built upon, these are the values that unite our citizens, and these are the values that powered our civilization to its towering Heights, lifting billions from poverty, healing disease, curing illness, and reaching new summits of scientific endeavor, artistic triumph, and human achievement. Guided by these timeless convictions, my administration has been delivering historic gains for the American people, like no one has ever done in the first three and a half years of a presidency, not even close, it’s not even close.
Donald Trump: (26:09)
By the end of my first term, we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved. 300. If you get 10, it’s a lot. 300. An all time record, and very importantly, we confirm two great Supreme Court justices. And we have to win because obviously we need more justices on the Supreme Court. People don’t realize how important that is. I’ve always heard it’s the most important thing you can do. I always said defense, but that’s right there. Supreme court justices and judges, and we are setting records.
Donald Trump: (27:01)
We’ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the awesome power of the United States military. And I very proudly created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces, the Space Force. Big deal, that’s a big deal. You think it’s just that? If you did just that, that’s like, “That’s a good presidency.” Think of that. That’s one of many, many things, we’ll go over a few of them, but many, many things. So the Air Force was the last one. That was 75 years ago. The Air Force, 75 years ago, we just created another branch. We’re going to have a general, a nice general. We have right now on the joint chiefs of staff a full deal, and that’s a great honor because space is going to be very important.
Donald Trump: (28:06)
At first, they smiled when I came up with the idea. I never talked about it in the campaign. I don’t think I ever mentioned it once. It’s just an idea that I learned as I was going through military and a really an amazing thing. Space is going to be so important, that will be one of our most important of all. And it’s an honor. We’re now doing a hydrosonic. I call it Super Dupers missile. It goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile right now. 17.
Donald Trump: (28:44)
We pass VA choice, a big deal. And VA accountability, a big deal. They’ve been trying for 50 years, almost 50 years on boat, accountability. They couldn’t fire people that treated our vets badly. Now we can say you’re fired. Oh, by the way, you had a big deal. That’s right. That’s right, you had a big deal in Arizona. I’ve been reading about it for years now. Doug, where they had somebody stealing in the VA, and they caught them cold, like 500,000. That’s a lot. They stole 500,000. They couldn’t fire them. They couldn’t fire them. So between the unions, and civil service, and all of the things, they couldn’t fire them. But we made it so that you can now say, “You’re fired. Get out.” And they’ll give our veterans the care they so richly deserve.
Donald Trump: (29:35)
Choice is so big, instead of waiting for a week, two weeks, five weeks, you have no idea how bad it was. If they have to wait, and they have great doctors, we have great doctors in the VA. If you have to wait, if for any reason there’s a delay, you go outside, you get a doctor, you get fixed up, we pay the bill. And it sounds expensive. It’s cheap. We saved money. Most important, we save lives. People would get online, and they’re okay, not feeling well. By the time they see a doctor, in some cases they are terminally ill, it would take weeks and weeks, and now we have VA choice, that’s why you see good stories, 91% approval rating. 91% approval rating. VA choice. Nobody thought we were going to get that one done.
Donald Trump: (30:28)
We passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms. And we passed the largest number of regulation cuts by a factor of many times, no other administration, even though in some cases, eight years, and in one case more, nobody has cut regulation like we’ve got regulation, not even close. And it’s one of the reasons we did so well before the plague, and we’re doing so well after the plague. It’s going away. We eliminated Obamacare’s unfair individual mandate, which punished young Americans like you for the privilege of not buying bad health insurance. That’s really what it was. You had the privilege of not buying, and you had to pay for it. Not too good. So we got rid of it. That was a big deal. That was one of the most unpopular things anywhere, on any subject.
Donald Trump: (31:27)
We will always protect people with preexisting conditions, and you have Martha’s pledge that she is going to do that also. So we’re going to do that. And the Democrats can’t make that pledge because they’re going to raise your taxes like crazy. I never heard, all my life, I think Doug can maybe explain it, but Doug, all my life I’d watch, and the best politicians, they want to cut taxes, not raise taxes. All of a sudden we’re in an age where things are very different, let’s face it, ripping down statues. One of the things is the Democrats want to raise your taxes to a level that nobody can even believe. And it won’t be nearly enough to pay for what they want to do. You talk about bad healthcare. It’s just going to be a disaster. But they want to raise everybody’s Texas. I always thought it was supposed to be the other way. But let’s see how they do on November 3rd, I don’t think they going to do to well.
Donald Trump: (32:26)
We passed Right To Try to give critically ill patients access to life saving cures, so they don’t have to travel all around the world and see if they can find, and we’ve had tremendous success with that. Right To Try. Very proud of it. They’ve been trying to get that one done for 40 years. And I’ve just come from the Arizona border, Yuma, where we marked the completion of over 220 miles, a brand new, beautiful border wall. You know, you don’t hear about that, they don’t want to talk about the wall anymore, do you notice. Never has the Democrat Party fought so hard against something. And do you notice they never talk about the wall, because in the end they gave it up. They give up. We won. We’re building fully funded.
Donald Trump: (33:48)
I could build numerous walls with all the money I have. Fully funded. But you know why they don’t talk about it? Because it’s a bad subject. Remember they used to say, it’s obsolete. “We want drones.” Oh great, the drones flying around. We’re going to watch everyone pour into our country with a drone. Remember they said the wall’s obsolete. And I said today, nobody heard it. I thought it was sort of… I think I said it, but I’m sure people have said it over the years. You’re in an industry, and in many cases, you have a computer, in about two weeks it’s old, it’s obsolete. In technology, I said to some of the people, I meet them all, I say, “The problem with your business, it gets obsolete quick.”
Donald Trump: (34:28)
Two things that will never be obsolete, a wheel and a wall. Never. And they said that wall is obsolete, with modern technology. No, no modern technology is like let’s watch everybody pour in. Now we have a wall. So we’ve built 220 miles. We’re going to have a… And it’s every single element, I met with border patrol who are fantastic, by the way, every single element they wanted, you have to see through which makes sense. You have to do all of the different… We have cameras on it. We have sensors on it. It is just 20, 30 feet high. It’s very hard. We have anti-climb provision on the top. We have the whole deal. And it’s very powerful. And by the way, where that wall is, nobody’s getting through. Nobody gets through. We put a chunk… California, off the record, California was saying, “Please, can we have the wall?” This is California. They didn’t want the wall, they didn’t want the wall. But they wanted the wall, because right next to San Diego is a wonderful town in Mexico. You know the town, I won’t mention the name, but they’re heavily infected with COVID… Did you ever notice notice…. I said the other night, did anybody see my speech the other night on Saturday night? But I said the other night, there’s never been anything where they have so many names. I could give you 19 or 20 names for that. It’s got all different names, Wuhan. Kawuhan was catching on. Coronavirus. Kung flu. COVID-19. I said what’s the 19, COVID-19, some people can’t explain what the 19, give me… COVID-19, I said, “That’s an odd name.” I could give you many, many names. Some people call it the Chinese flu, the China flu. They call it the China, as opposed to the China.
Donald Trump: (36:50)
I never said anything like it, but here’s the story. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and going to be soon. I think you’ll remember… Now Biden was going around like he’s a tough guy. He doesn’t know where the hell he is. Where? Where are you Joe? Joe, where are you Joe? Tell me where you are, Joe. But he’s going around, I stood up for China. No, his son walked out with 1.5 billion to manage, and what he did… Where’s Hunter? Remember? I said, “Where’s Hunter?” They came out with this t-shirt and some guy made a fortune, Where’s Hunter. By the way, Where is Hunter? He did well as Vice President, could you imagine how Hunter’s going to do if this guy ever won, and the father could honestly say, “I have no idea what’s going on.” He could raise his hand.
Donald Trump: (37:48)
Is that Kayleigh? Where’s Kayleigh? Where’s Mc Kayleigh? What a job she’s done, our press secretary. Everyone’s doing well, our press secretary, [inaudible 00:38:20] press secretary. I mean, Sarah is going to be the governor of Arkansas pretty soon, I hope. Sean’s got his own show, and this one here, she could run whatever the hell she wanted, but I said, “Don’t run. Don’t run, just stay here. We like the job do.” Now we’re doing great.
Donald Trump: (38:36)
I stood up to China like no other administration in history. For decades they’ve ripped us off. They ripped us off like nobody. And I charged them a little thing called the massive tariffs. We took in billions and billions of dollars. They devalued their currency, and they like to say our people paid. No, no, our people didn’t pay. They devalued their currency in order to pay it, and they also put money out, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to sell that product. But what happened for many years, there’s nobody ever that ripped off the United States like China. Nobody. So now we did a deal, but you know, the ink wasn’t dry when the plague flew in. The ink, wasn’t dry. The deal was great. Everybody was happy. I was thrilled. $250 billion worth of purchases over a short period of time. All grate. But the ink wasn’t dry, and we got hit by the plague. So I’m not too happy about that. But the long slow surrender is over because today and every day we are putting now America first. America comes from.
Donald Trump: (39:54)
We sparked a revolution in domestic energy production, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet earth. America, as of a couple of years ago is no longer energy dependent, we are now energy dominant. And because our energy use went down so much during this pandemic, it was a very, very bad period of time because we have 10 million jobs, energy jobs, and now we have the oil price up, where it should be, and yet people are paying very little for gasoline. That’s like the perfect thing. That’s the perfect thing to do.
Donald Trump: (40:41)
And I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform, which nobody was able to get done. Very important. Very important. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. Nobody knows that. And we created opportunities zones along with Tim Scott, and since then, countless jobs in $100 billion of new investment have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods in the country, 9,000. Opportunity Zones. So think of it. I did criminal justice reform. We did a lot of work on prison or prison reform. We did opportunity zones. Think of this. Think of all we’ve done, and we’ve taken care of the black colleges and universities, and nobody talks about it, but I have to talk about it. And you know what? Our black communities know it. And I think you’re going to see something really great happened because they understand it. They really understand it.
Donald Trump: (42:00)
And I’ll tell you what, whether it’s any community you talk about, but if you take a look at those numbers from pre-virus, but you take a look at them in a year from now, you watch. And you’re 401s right now, your 401k’s, I don’t think you want to have somebody else playing with them because you’re just about at a record high, and you put the wrong person in, they will be obliterated. They will be obliterated. So we’re fighting for school choice because we know that access to education is a civil rights. School choice. Could you ever see two parties so diametrically opposed to each other? Who can be opposed to that, but it’s so important, but the Democrats will never, ever allow that to happen.
Donald Trump: (43:01)
Last month we returned American astronauts to space aboard American rockets for the first time in nearly a decade. And the United States will be the first nation to plant our beautiful American flag on planet Mars. And we destroyed 100% of the ISIS territorial caliphate, and the Savage terrorist monsters Al-Baghdadi and Kasseem Salamoni, they are both dead. A hundred percent. A hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. When I took over that caliphate was gone like this. It was a mess, but we destroyed it.
Donald Trump: (44:04)
No administration has accomplished more in just three and a half years. It is. I could go after…. Those are just a few points. I could talk for an hour and a half, just reading the points off. You know that. Yet as you know, in recent months, America has face down that unseen enemy. The virus from the distant land, that spread across the globe, and invaded our shores, but invaded the shores of, think of it, 188 nations. I have a friend he’s a very smart guy. He said, “I didn’t know there were that many nations.” I said, “Actually go over 200.” But 188 nations that we know of.
Speaker 1: (44:45)
We love you.
Donald Trump: (44:45)
I love you too. Thank you darling. Thank you. And tomorrow the fake news will be said, “He said he loved somebody, he said he loved somebody.” Terrible. I’ll be in big trouble with the fake news. They are terrible people. Who are the people that stood up. I just want to see. Stand up please. Who said I love you? Whoa. Sit down fast, please. Don’t let them see you. That’s a lot of press back there. Look at that. That’s the problem, they cover all these speeches. I never have a speech done. I never have a speech where not like live television. Sometimes you’ll have one where you can actually speak and you don’t have to worry about like one little slip, one tiny little slip, one word. You can say 10 speeches, one little word, they’ll say, ” He’s lost it.” No. You know who’s lost it? Sleepy Joe has lost.
Donald Trump: (46:17)
In response, we took swift and early action to ban travel from China, very, very early. Remember Nancy Pelosi and that crazy group. Nancy Pelosi, she wanted to dance in the streets of Chinatown and San Francisco, long after I ban China from coming here. We saved tens of thousands of lives with that early decision. And then we made an early decision on Europe. Yet liberal lawmakers and Democrat politicians condemned this policy to left rejected science in favor of their fanatical devotion to open borders. They want open borders, not just our Southern border. This is why the left is so dangerous. They always put their ideology before your safety. It’s crazy what’s going on. Defund and abolish the police. How’s that a good idea?
Donald Trump: (47:24)
I passed a set, I was in the white house and there was this set, and it had them, think of it, defund and abolish. I said, “What are they going to defund?” No, I said, it says, Defund and abolish. I said, “What are they going to defund and abolish?” I thought it was going to be something. They said the police. I said, “Oh great. I just won the election. That’s great.” So in addition to issuing a series of aggressive travel bans, my administration launched the greatest national mobilization since World War II, we have done such a great job with this, between the ventilators and all of these things, including testing. We’re testing so much. We’re now up to 27.5 million tests. I thought it was 25, because it seemed like 25 million. 27, they just told me, 27.5 million tests. Now, when you have all those tests, you have more cases. So the news covers it, “They have more cases.” Well, yeah, if you’re going to do 20, and if let’s say other countries do 1 million, 2 million, big countries, 3 million.
Donald Trump: (49:10)
Now four weeks ago, Germany was at 3 million tests. So I don’t know what they are now, but I know they’re not anywhere near where we are. So then they’ll say we have more cases. Now look, we want to do testing, we want to do everything, but they use it to make us look bad. But because of it, our mortality rate is so low. It’s so great what’s happening. So we want to test. So we do all these tests, and we find pockets, and we find people, and we find cases and they say the cases have jumped. Instead of saying what a job we’re doing with testing. But we did the job with testing. And we did ventilators. We came up with tests that nobody’s… We have so many different types of tests. We have the five minutes test, the 10 minutes test. We have tests, you send them to a public lab, a privately. We have tests. It’s a lot of tests.
Donald Trump: (50:02)
… privately. We have tests… It’s a lot of tests and other countries that have done very well with testing they call us, they say, “There’s nobody that’s been able to do the job that you’ve done.” Now, the only ones that can’t get to say that are the fake news media people, they can say. Someday, it will be recognized by history, someday. But our actions and your selfless sacrifice. And that’s what has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We had to do it and we did the right thing. I’ll tell you what we did the right thing. Now we open, we got to get it open because I said, I got to get it open. People need it. People get sick from the other also, it’s not just from the virus that gets sick from all of the other things that happen. You know what I mean?
Donald Trump: (50:51)
We cut through red tape to accelerate breakthrough therapies and vaccines. We’re going to have a vaccine very soon. We distributed 1. 5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment. We unleashed the medical and logistical power of the United States military. And thanks to our efforts, not a single American who needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. That’s impossible. That’s impossible.
Donald Trump: (51:24)
Remember when the New York governor, governor Cuomo said he needs 40,000 ventilators and people said, “No, no, you need 4,000, maybe 5,000.” Anyway, we got him what we thought was right. They never needed all of them. In fact, they gave some to other people, but he didn’t need 40… 40,000 as opposed to 4,000 or 5,000, then it worked out great. Then he wanted a hospital built in the Javits Convention Center. We built it, but he didn’t use it. He could have used it for the older people. It was brand new, not infected, no infection. Then he wanted the boat. He wanted the boat to come up. Beautiful, beautiful hospital ship. You know what that is called, right? And it came up. They could have used it for senior citizens. They didn’t use it. It’s a shame. It’s a shame. It’s a shame. We’re now the chief ventilator producer, anywhere in the world.
Donald Trump: (52:18)
We’re helping other countries with ventilators because ventilators are very hard to make. They’re very complex. They are big and expensive and many countries are calling us, asking for help. They need ventilators and we’re able to do it because we’re making thousands of ventilators. Think of this thousands of ventilators a week. And to rescue the US economy, which is happening now. We pass over $3 trillion in relief measures. We suspended student loan payments and interest for college students. And to protect jobs for young Americans, just like you, we took historic action to block the entry of foreign workers into our nation. We believe that companies should hire American workers and American students first. They have to hire. We got to go American. We got to go American. We were down to 3.4, 3.5% unemployment and that’s one thing, but now we’ve got to get it back to those numbers. Then we can think, right? Then we can think about taking people in through merit, only through merit or mostly through a merit. I better say mostly because they’ll say that’s a terrible thing. You can’t make a little bit of a slip. They’ll say, “He said only what about this? What about that?” Generally speaking, we like merit. Okay. We want American students to fill American jobs. That’s the biggest difference between us and the left. We know that our first duty is to take care of our citizens, make America great again. So before the plague came in, we had the best of everything. We had the best interest rates. We had the best unemployment rates. We had the best job numbers ever. We had everything. Unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans had all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. It’s amazing how many categories, young people, young people without a high school diploma, young people without a college diploma. We were number one on every list you can think of. Women 75 years, not as good, I’m sorry. But it was getting ready to hit the all time. Women it was the best in 75 years. So I have to apologize. Can you believe that we did the best in 75 years and I apologize to women. But we were ready to hit the old time. And then we got hit by something that should have never happened because they could’ve stopped it. Young people have seen their wages rise by more than 10%. They’d never seen anything like that.
Donald Trump: (55:29)
We built the strongest and most prosperous economy in the history of the world. And we will do it again very, very quickly. It’s happening already. We’ve just added two and a half million jobs last month. Think of that. That’s the largest increase in the history of our country, two and a half million jobs in one month. And just to add the topping, as I mentioned, the 18% in retail sales, the surge was the biggest jump ever recorded in this country. The stock market in the last 50 days is the best stock market in history. And it went up today again, by the way, think of that, think of that.
Donald Trump: (56:19)
Go back a week, 50 days, the strongest 50 days in stock market history. This is during hopefully the end of the pandemic, but as we fight to restore renew and rebuild our country, the hard left is trying to divide, denigrate, and destroy our country. The American people have watched in horror as left wing extremists have looted businesses, violently assaulted innocent civilians, and brutally injured hundreds and hundreds of police officers. Our great police officers. They even vandalized, that’s right, the Lincoln Memorial. The Lincoln Memorial. The radical left thinks the future belongs to them. No, the future belongs to you. It belongs to people that love our country.
Donald Trump: (57:20)
So we’re not going to take moral lectures from the same left wing ideologues who oppose school choice, who support deadly sanctuary cities, who want to defend our police to fund and abolish our police. Think of it, to fund and abolish is now their theme and who preside over the violence and mayhem of the 20 most dangerous cities in America, 20 for 20. 20, most dangerous run by Democrats and it’ll happen to our country. If a guy like Joe Biden gets in. Because Joe Biden has no control over what’s happening. They won’t even be talking to him. The murder rate in Detroit and Baltimore is higher than that of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Afghanistan. But the left launches no protests over these travesties. There are travesties. Because it doesn’t serve their radical agenda. Think of that, tougher than Afghanistan, all run by Democrats while their movement is based on hate. Ours is based on love. Love of our family. Love of our nation and love of our fellow citizens.
Donald Trump: (58:55)
We embrace the noble vision of Reverend Martin Luther King jr. And believed that people should not be judged based on the color of their skin, but the content of their character. This is a choice of two futures. The left’s vision of this unity and discord or our vision of equal opportunity and equal justice. Every American should take a long look at the bedlam in Seattle, because that’s exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in America. If the radical left Democrats are put in charge. They want to abolish ICE. Do you have any idea how patriotic ICE people are? I know them. They are very tough. They’re very tough. I agree. They like to fight. I agree.
Donald Trump: (01:00:09)
But you don’t want to… I’m looking at some pretty tough guys right here. Look, you’re not going to do. He’s not going into an MS 13 ness, swinging, swinging. These guys are tough. They’re smart. They getting them out by the thousands to take in MS 13, out of our country, by the thousands. They want to abolish ICE, get rid of ICE, abolish bail. There want no bail anymore. Just we put you in for murder. It’s okay, come back, whenever you have a chance. You see what’s going on in some places like Philadelphia, what’s happening in Philadelphia. What’s happening in other cities. Look at what’s going on in Chicago. What’s that all about? Chicago is a great city, but they want to abolish borders and abolish every police department in the country.
Donald Trump: (01:01:02)
The Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail in ballots, using the China virus, as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls. Hey, we have a virus coming, we have to send… Think of it, California. He’s going to be sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, where are they going? Where are these ballots going? Who’s getting them? Who is not getting them? Little section that’s Republican. Will they be stolen from mailboxes, as they get put in by the mailman? Will they be taken from the mailman and the mailwoman? Will they be forged? Who is signing them? Who’s signing them. What are they signed at a kitchen table and sent in? Will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation? Will they be counterfeited maybe by the millions by foreign powers who don’t want to see Trump win? Because nobody has been tougher on trade or making our country great again. Nobody. No mail in ballots is a disaster for our country. It’s going to end up in a big fight.
Donald Trump: (01:02:28)
Look just forget about all of this stuff. Forget about speeches and teleprompters and all of that. They send out millions of ballots. Who’s getting them? How are they delivered? Who’s not getting them? Think of it. It’s going to be fraud all over the place. If you look right now, look at all of the disputes they’re having on mail in ballots. A friend of mine who was a great guy, had a son who passed away seven years ago, seven years ago. He came to see me the other day. He said, “They just sent to my son Robert, a mail in ballot.” He died seven years ago. There’s no way they can control that. With mail in ballots, you introduce something in the middle of an election year and you have something where it’s very complex. You have no time to fix this very complex process. It’s very complex. This will be in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country and we cannot let this happen. They want it to happen so badly.
Donald Trump: (01:03:41)
We believe in the sacred principle of one person, one vote. And that’s why we are fighting for the integrity of our elections. Absentee ballots are fine. Absentee ballots are fine. I live in the white house. If I can’t get to Florida or you live wherever you live, you can’t. But you have to go through a process. Some people just can’t make it to a polling station and they have good reason, but they have to go through this process in order to verify their identity. People went to the polls and voted during World War I. They went to the polls and voted during World War II. We can safely go to the polls and vote during COVID-19.
Donald Trump: (01:04:48)
There’s tremendous evidence of fraud, whenever you have mail in ballots. Frankly, if we are really going to protect our elections and some people don’t want to hear this, we must have voter ID. So as long as I’m president, America will be a land of fair laws, swift justice, and safe communities. That’s why when rioting and looting broke out in our nation’s capital, I quickly deployed. I came in, I deployed the national guard very quickly. Mark Meadows was there. We had a lot of our people there. We stopped the violence. We saved that incredible statue you saw it last night. And restored peace and order to the streets. Although I will tell you, they did great damage to the cannons that were on the ground. They did great damage, but we’ll get them fixed. We’ll get them fixed, lock them up, lock them up.
Donald Trump: (01:06:06)
It’s incredible how they can do it. Incredible. Well, they did damage. We lucky we just got there in time. You saw the ropes going up. We got that just… I’ll tell you, law enforcement did a great job. They rushed in. They rushed in. These people fought back and the law enforcement was much tougher, much sharper, much better. They really had no trouble handling them. It was like handling a baby for them. It was just like a baby. A lot of spoiled people in that group. A lot of spoiled rich people saying, “What are you doing here?” I’ve also made clear that any rioters damaging federal property and defacing our monuments will face severe and lengthy criminal penalties, 10 years. Many of the young people here today have had your own encounters with left wing extremists, such as Antifa. Joining us today are two students from North Carolina State University. Great place. Great state, Chris Thomas and Jack Bishop, please come on up fellas. Come on up.
Jack Bishop: (01:07:35)
How are you guys Phoenix? Awesome. Listen, thank you so much, Mr. President. It’s great to be out here in Phoenix. The first I’ve ever been here. I’ve got to say it’s been the experience of a lifetime. Now listen I’m going to keep this short and sweet. I just want to say that conservative censorship on campus is real and it’s happening all across the country. All the time.
Jack Bishop: (01:08:09)
This past year at NC State, we were having a event. Our turning point chapter was for Charlie Kirk and Lara Trump at her Alma mater NC State. We were posting advertisements in our free expression tunnel, where you’re allowed to paint whatever you want. We were making some advertisements and we had about 20 socialist thugs roll up from Antifa and from the young democratic socialists of America. Now for our trouble, of course, they roll up and attacked us. They started spraying all over the work that we had just done. And for my trouble of, I stood the line and tried my best to keep them from defacing our ads and for my trouble, I was spray painted in the eye.
Jack Bishop: (01:09:03)
Yeah. Yeah. And unsurprisingly, of course the school did nothing. There’s a surprise. They let Antifa run rough shot over our event. They let them in the room with us, they were protesting, screaming so loud that you could barely hear the speakers the entire time. And of course, NC State like many administrations across the country does the will of the radical left. Meanwhile, conservatives across the country are punished and blacklisted merely for expressing our own opinions. We’re ostracized and ousted with no support whatsoever from the administration. But let me tell you, when administrations across the country do the will of the left and cater to the mob. It’s our duty as conservatives to stand up and to fight for our rights and to fight for our nation and to fight for our guy. And you know Mr. President, my dad, Congressman Dan Bishop, he likes to say that you like to say that he’s not a choker.
Jack Bishop: (01:10:24)
And let me tell you, Mr. President, us college conservatives, we ain’t chokers neither. We’re going to win this election. We’re going to take back the house. We’re going to keep the Senate and we’re going to get four more years of the best President in my lifetime, the presidency of Donald J. Trump. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America.
Chris Thomas: (01:10:59)
Mr. President, thank you so much. It’s an honor to be here with you today. Thank you for giving attention to our situation when the mainstream media back there wouldn’t touch the story. Conservatives across this country are treated different every day by their professors and other students on campus. I was mocked by a leftist on my campus, not for my conservative beliefs, but for a medical condition. I have the impacts, my hair growth and my ability to sweat. I’ll learn that when these leftist ideas fail, they resort to personal attacks because they have no facts to back up their radical beliefs.
Chris Thomas: (01:11:42)
Imagine how much of a fit the mainstream media would have thrown if 15 to 20 kids in MAGA hats had come up and spray painted a kid in the eye and made someone else for a medical condition they have. Our school North Carolina State did not do anything about this. They didn’t discipline them. And it was no coincidence that the Antifa logo showed up on the free expression tunnel the next day. We are blessed to have a president like you, that is devoted to protecting free speech on college campuses. And thank you, president Trump and students for Trump, let’s keep America great.
Donald Trump: (01:12:38)
Great job fellows. Thank you. So I signed an executive order, as you know, and based on what I’m just hearing, you should maybe be talking to Charlie or somebody around here about defunding that school. You can’t do that. Because that’s exactly what the executive order was based on. So you talked to the people, maybe have your father call us. His father’s a great Congressman, done a great job. So say hello to him. But you talk to them. That’s exactly what it was for. We did something that was radical, but it wasn’t radical to me. You have to be heard. And if you can’t be heard, let’s talk about it. Okay. As the radical left inflict violence on American streets, they’re also waging war on timeless American values like freedom of speech, which is what we’re just talking about.
Donald Trump: (01:13:36)
Anyone who dares to speak the truth is canceled, censored, deplatformed, fired, expelled, harassed, abused, boycotted deprived of a livelihood or even physically assaulted. Those times will be changing very soon. You can judge a movement by its behavior and the young patriots here today, don’t destroy property. You don’t burn buildings, you don’t punish the centers, and you don’t try to erase the people with whom you disagree. It’s called civilized people. You’re civilized people. And yet, remember I said this, you’re civilized, but you’re much tougher than the other side. You’re much tougher, much tougher. You conduct yourselves with honor, integrity, and dignity because you know the truth, the facts, and the history all on your side. We’re joined today by Reagan Escada a student at Northwestern State University of Louisiana. Reagan became a target of liberal cancel culture when she dared to stand up for Christian…
Donald Trump: (01:15:03)
… Cancel culture when she dared to stand up for her Christian values, instead of bowing to political correctness. Reagan, please come up and say a few words please.
Reagan Escudé: (01:15:24)
Well, thank you Mr. President for being here today with all of us, and for inviting me up here to tell of my experience with cancel culture. My name is Reagan Escudé, I graduated from Northwestern State University of Louisiana in 2019. I started my first job at a small private insurance company in Louisiana. A few weeks ago amidst all this chaos that we’re seeing with the Black Lives Matter movement, I made a video on my Instagram, and I talked about how disappointed I am in the church’s reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement. I’ve seen pastors call for white congregants to kneel and to apologize for the skin that God gave them. I addressed these evangelical pastors and leaders, and reminded them that racism is a problem in the heart. It is a sin problem that cannot be resolved by any law, protest or march. Of course my leftist followers didn’t appreciate this message at all. I had my name blasted all over social media, and people told me, “I’m ashamed if I’ve ever called you my friend. I’ve lost all respect for you.” I love y’all. An ex-coworker of mine made a post on Facebook about me calling me racist and homophobic. She listed my place of employment, and called for people to call my employer and have me fired. There were death threats made to the owners. There were threats to knock down the building, law enforcement had to get involved. Due to the crazy reaction from the leftist mob my employer told me that they came to the conclusion that they needed to terminate my employment. But here’s the thing, losing my job is a small price to pay when God’s name is being glorified. He will always make His name known.
Reagan Escudé: (01:17:56)
But I share this story with you, because what happened to me is just a small example of something that’s happening on a much larger scale in our nation. Aunt Jemima was canceled. If you didn’t know Nancy Green, the original first Aunt Jemima, she was a picture of the American dream. She was a freed slave who went on to be the face of the pancake syrup that we love and have in our pantries today. She fought for equality, and now the leftist mob is trying to erase her legacy. Might I mentioned how privileged we are as a nation if our biggest concern is a bottle of pancake syrup. More recently, we’re seeing a call for statues of Jesus Christ to be torn down. Now I’m a little confused here because last week Jesus was a social justice warrior, and this week He’s the face of white supremacy.
Reagan Escudé: (01:19:11)
Jimmy Kimmel has been calling our president racist for years, and it turns out he’s the racist. There’s governors that are getting away with wearing blackface that’s just sliding under the radar. I want to encourage you all to stand firm in your beliefs. We need truth. We need hard cold facts and truth now more than we ever have before, and we are so blessed to have a president who stands on the front lines, walks through the fire every day to fight for our God-given American freedoms. Do not apologize to the mob, and thank you President Trump for never apologizing to the mob. For always standing firm, for being here for the American people, and for fighting for our best interests because you are the change that we need to see in America. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:20:36)
Thank you Reagan. That was beautiful. As your story reminds us Reagan, true courage is defying the left’s orthodoxy, not submitting to it. We don’t submit, nobody should be submitting because we’re winning and we’re going to win, but you don’t submit to fake news progressive companies right there. They’re right back there watching us. Other institutions merely towing the left wing line have sacrificed their intellectual credibility and professional integrity. They have very little integrity left. Some of them have none. You’re the ones taking real risks. You’re showing real guts and making a virtuous stand.
Donald Trump: (01:21:21)
With the rise of social media massive multinational tech companies have tried to clamp down on American democracy. That even means on me. As everyone knows, they’re using their enormous power to silence conservative voices, you know that. It’s not even close. I don’t even think they’re hiding it anymore. To protect our democracy I signed an executive order to remove legal protections for social media companies that unjustly censor American citizens. The radical left is also working to eliminate free speech on our college campuses. With us today is Nia Moore, a student at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota, whose experience is persecution firsthand. Nia, please come up, please.
Nia Moore: (01:22:43)
First I just want to say thank you to Mr. President for having me on stage today. If you didn’t know much about Minnesota about a month ago, I’m sure you’ve seen us in the headlines over the past few weeks. The DFL is successfully moving our state farther to the left more and more each day. Now that isn’t because people aren’t conservative in Minnesota, it’s because they’re hell-bent on demonizing us at every turn. I began my career working in politics with Turning Point USA. Unfortunately, due to the leftist culture of my campus at North Hennepin, we were shut down almost immediately and were refused official recognition. I was told by the faculty that political groups were not welcome on campus. However, they had multiple leftist groups that supported the Black Lives Matter movement. They were pro-abortion, and they’ve advocated for Bernie Sanders.
Nia Moore: (01:23:56)
Our governor, the mayor, sorry. Our governor, the mayor of Minneapolis, and the representative of the 5th Congressional District in Minnesota are all Democrats, but for whatever reason, the Republicans and the president take the blame for what has taken place. Unfortunately, the murder of George Floyd has created absolute chaos in my state of Minnesota. They have… Sorry I lost my place. Ever since the murder of George Floyd, I have not seen as much division, deceit and destruction in my life. Black Lives Matter only makes a scene during election years. How convenient that they made the biggest scene of all during the year of the most important election of our time? Black Lives Matter is only about police brutality once every four years. In between, they’re heavily funding a push for leftist and LGBTQ plus agendas.
Nia Moore: (01:25:19)
The black community’s culture is naturally very conservative, so they mask their hidden agendas and play on the community’s biggest fear. If Black Lives Matter truly cared about black lives, they would not have allowed the riots to destroy black businesses and black communities. If they cared about black lives, they would defund planned parenthood. If Black Lives Matter cared about black lives, they would adjust the astronomically high numbers of black on black crime in inner cities. They try to paint us as the bad guys for not supporting the organization, but it’s not the saying black lives matter. I think there’s very few conservatives that believe black lives don’t matter. We do believe black lives matter, we just believe they all matter, not just the lives the left chooses to exploit.
Nia Moore: (01:26:46)
I am a field director for Ilhan Omar’s challenger, Lacy Johnson. He’s the first Republican in Minnesota to have Black Lives Matter activists and lifelong Democrats want to hear what he has to say. Because of that, they’ve tried to silence us at every turn. People are fed up and they’re getting nervous. They will stop at nothing to keep their hold on us, even if that means lying to the very people they’re supposed to represent. Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for being a great example of a big-tent Republican. The president has never needed the black vote to win, but he’s still done incredible work with prison reform, lowering black unemployment, funding HBCUs, and stimulating the black community with Opportunities Zones. All without pandering. Once upon a time, the president asked the black community what we had to lose. We didn’t have anything, but now we do. Thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:28:26)
Thank you. Thank you Nia. Well Nia I want to just tell you, first of all thank you very much, and so heartfelt. I could see that. I also issued a historical executive order defending free speech and all of this is on college campuses. I will tell you that it’s something that’s being used by people like Charlie and used very well. It’s opening up a whole new voice, and it’s my honor to have done it under my order. Any college that refuses to let you speak stands to lose billions of dollars in terms of the [inaudible 01:29:15]. We’ve done a lot. We’ve really gone very far. We’ve taken it to a level that nobody’s ever taken it, and it’s my honor to have done it. It’s people like you that I do it for. When you think about it, it’s people like you. You’re going to be the ones, you’re going to be the ones that are at the crossroads of history. That’s where you are right now, you’re at a crossroads.
Donald Trump: (01:29:37)
Everything our forefathers built, everything generations past, they shed their blood to defend the very survival of our freedoms, our rights and our republic. They’re all at stake. This is a very big time in our country. It’s a time like perhaps no other. But standing here before you today I have never been more confident that America will rise to new heights of greatness and glory. Because your generation is proving that your hearts are filled with the fire and the fervor of true American patriots. The great spirit of righteous defiance stirs deep within you I see that. It’s the same spirit that drove America’s founders and frontiersmen, people that built our nation. People that succeeded, people that worked hard, people that failed, people that failed. Some people failed and then they made it bigger than anyone would have ever believed possible. To defend all of your liberties, to secure your independence and establish this noble fortress of freedom.
Donald Trump: (01:30:57)
It’s the same spirit that compels each of you to stand strong against the dull, mindless, soul-crushing conformity mandated by far left pundits, professors and liberal politicians. They’re taking our country in the wrong direction. It’s the same fierce and untamed American spirit that will lead the young patriotic Americans of this generation to serve our country, and you will serve it well, you will serve it so well. Together we will restore our economy quickly. We will rebuild our nation. We will revitalize our cities. We will take back our universities and colleges, and we will preserve the America we love for you and for your children.
Donald Trump: (01:31:52)
We will defend our values, our voices, our faith, our heritage, our borders, our rights, and our God- given freedoms. Calling on the boldness and bravery of your generation, we will unite citizens of every race and color, religion and creed as one people, one family, and one extraordinary nation under God. With your help, this moment will be a turning point in American history that will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come for our young people, for our economy, for our communities and for our beloved country. The best is yet to come. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Jun 23, 2020","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Doug, right? I was just given a beautiful picture of the wall, that’s before and after and it’s quite a difference. One area you walk over, you drive over, you do whatever you want. And the other one you say, “Well, I guess we don’t get in.” Here’s another one, just given. That’s great, that’s a different section. Pretty amazing, they’ve done a great job. We’re up to 212, more than that now, about 220, but over 212 miles, and we’ll be very close to 500 miles by the end of the year. And that’s the area that we wanted. So it’s great, and thank you all for being here. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (00:44)
And I’m thrilled to be in Yuma, Arizona. They’ve treated me very nicely in Arizona, so we’re very happy about that. Mr. Governor, right? To commemorate the completion of more than 200 miles of powerful border wall, we’re on pace to complete 450 miles by the end of the year and 500 miles almost immediately thereafter, we may even have the 500 miles by the end of the year, we’re doing a real job. The Army Corps of Engineers, I want to thank them, they’ve been incredible.
Donald Trump: (01:14)
This is the most powerful and comprehensive border wall structure anywhere in the world. It’s got technology that nobody would even believe between sensors and cameras and everything else. With us today are acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, who has done a fantastic job. Thank you, Chad. Commissioner Mark Morgan. Mark, thank you very much. Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, who’s doing a fantastic job at the Army Corps. We have interesting construction talk, don’t we?
Lieutenant General Todd Semonite: (01:46)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:47)
Really great stuff. President of the National Border Patrol Council, Brandon Judd. Hello, Brandon, what are you doing sitting back there? I’ve never seen that before. You’re always up here with me. You’re getting low key lately, that’s confidence, that means he’s got a lot of confidence, that’s great. And thank you for everything, Brandon. Say hello to everybody. Great job you do, appreciate it. He was a supporter of mine before I ran. He said, “I hope that guy runs.” Right? So I appreciate it very much. We won’t forget it either. And several other, very dedicated and heroic members of law enforcement. I met just a few of them back there and they gave me a beautiful replica of the wall, a little shorter version, but that’s okay. And we want to thank everybody.
Donald Trump: (02:34)
We’re also joined by some of my very good friends and people have great respect for you, you have a great governor in this state and has been a great friend for the state, but he’s been a great friend to our nation and does just a great job, Doug Ducey.
Doug Ducey: (02:49)
Thank you [crosstalk 00:02:51].
Donald Trump: (02:50)
Thank you very much Doug, appreciate it. Talk to you in a little while.
Doug Ducey: (02:52)
[crosstalk 00:02:52].
Donald Trump: (02:53)
Appreciate it. Senator Martha McSally, who I hear is doing a very well. We need you in Washington, will you please win? Because we need you.
Senator Martha McSally: (03:04)
[crosstalk 00:03:03].
Donald Trump: (03:04)
The alternative that’s running against you is not the person that we want, he’s got things that we don’t want. So we want you to win this race, it’s very important and we appreciate all the help that you’ve given us, especially on the border wall. We appreciate it, Martha, thank you very much. Representative Debbie Lesko has become a tremendous friend of mine and supporter and with the impeachment hoax, she was right up front. And it was good for you, you became very famous. I became more famous and you became very, very famous, right?
Representative Debbie Lesko: (03:36)
[inaudible 00:03:36].
Donald Trump: (03:36)
Well, it certainly didn’t hurt. She was one of the really great advocates who’s terrific. We appreciate it, Debbie, thank you. Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls, and thank you Douglas very much for being here.
Mayor Douglas Nicholls: (03:51)
Welcome back to Yuma.
Donald Trump: (03:52)
Thank you very much, it’s really an honor. And Yuma Police Chief Susan Smith. Thank you Susan very much for being here. So my administration has done more than any administration in history to secure our Southern border. Our border has never been more secure. I think Doug can tell you that, anybody at this table can tell you that. It’s never even been close. The numbers now, including not only the wall, the wall has helped a lot, where we have that 200 miles, 212 and now to 220, it’s really essentially almost, I guess, 99.6 or something like that. Maybe somebody can get an extraordinarily long ladder, but once you get up there, it gets very high. And it’s just about unclimbable, so it’s really great.
Donald Trump: (04:43)
That’s made a big difference, but we have other things that we’ve done. During the past two months, we’ve seen the lowest number of illegal border crossings in many years. Illegal immigration is down 84% from this time last year, illegal crossings from Central America are down 97%. Now the news, I won’t say fake news, I want to be nice today, so the news will say, “97%, Doug, that’s not very good.” But 97%, I would say sounds pretty good.
Male: (05:14)
A plus.
Donald Trump: (05:15)
Your sure it’s 97, right?
Male: (05:16)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
That’s a pretty good number you’re doing. 97% down, nearly 450,000 pounds of drugs have been seized this year, and 2,337 criminal aliens have been apprehended. We’ve stopped asylum fraud, ended catch and release. If you look at so many of the different crimes that come through the border, they’re stopped. We’ve implemented groundbreaking agreements with Mexico, I want to thank the President of Mexico, he’s really a great guy. I think he’ll be coming into Washington pretty soon to The White House, but they have a total of what’s the number today, would you say? Soldiers? What you say?
Male: (05:57)
Over 20,000, sir.
Donald Trump: (05:58)
Yeah, over 20… So we’ve had 27,000, 28,000, 25,000… Mexican soldiers are on our border making sure people aren’t coming across. So I want to also say that we’ve made a lot of progress with Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, and now when somebody comes over, whether it’s MS-13 or anybody else, we bring them back and they take them gladly. In the previous administration, they didn’t take them at all, they wouldn’t take them. They said, “You keep them.”
Donald Trump: (06:27)
Using our emergency public health authorities we prevented a coronavirus catastrophe on the Southern border, shutting down human smuggling and swiftly returning the crosses, we call them crosses. They cross now, we bring them right back. In the old days it would take years to get them back, they wouldn’t get them back. Other administrations like the previous administration, essentially didn’t bring them back.
Donald Trump: (06:52)
Without these public health measures the Southern border would be a global epicenter of the viral transmission. And if you look at some of the towns on the other side of the wall, as an example in California, we have a certain area that is heavily infected on the Mexico side and if we didn’t have a border wall there it would be really a catastrophic situation. So I just want to thank everyone, the Biden people, and he’s controlled totally by the radical left, as you understand, he’s not controlling it, they’re controlling him. They want open borders, they want criminal sanctuaries, they want everything that doesn’t work. I don’t even think it works politically, frankly, at this point, people see what happened. You’ll take a look at what’s happening in Seattle or take a look, Minnesota, such a great, great state. But you look at Minneapolis and you see what happened there, until we sent in… We sent in the National Guard, we said, “You got to do it.” Soon as they were there, boom, shut down. All the problems they had shut down, you didn’t hear about them anymore. And many other places. Last night in Washington, we heard they were going to take down the statue, Washington D.C., the statue of Andrew Jackson, a beautiful statue in Lafayette park. And Mark Meadows is here, he heard about it, I heard about it. We sent people there and law enforcement did an incredible job. They ran into that place and we were minutes away, that was a sneak attack. And now we’ve enacted an act, a very specific statue and monument act that puts people in jail for 10 years if they do anything to even try to deface one of our monuments or statues. So we have numerous people in prison right now, others are going there. And we’re going to look at that from a standpoint of retroactivity, we can go back and look at some of the damage they’ve done.
Donald Trump: (08:53)
But largely it’s State damage because the States have been very weak, extremely weak in protecting their heritage and protecting their culture. So the States are going to have to take care of themselves, but we’re there to help, if they want we’ll gladly help. But the federal statues, monuments, buildings, various things that we have, including, if you look at the Jefferson Memorial, or the Lincoln Memorial, they want to take down… George Washington, how about that one? That’s a new one. We heard that the other day. George Washington, I don’t think we’ll let that happen, Doug, right? I don’t think we’re going to let that happen. But George Washington and so many others. I really don’t even think frankly, they know who they’re taking down. I think they just want to do things for bad purposes. And these aren’t protesters, these are agitators and others. So we’ve taken a very strong stance and it won’t be happening federally, if it does, they’re going to pay a very big price. And they know that, it won’t be happening with the federal statues and monuments. So with that, I’d like to just introduce Chad Wolf, to say a few words about the job we’ve done on general security, not just the Southern border, the Southern border has been a primary focus as everyone knows, because tremendous amounts of drugs and other things coming in. And human trafficking, we have that down to the lowest number we’ve had in many years and again, being helped a lot by the length of our wall, which is going to be complete very soon. So Chad say a few words, please.
Chad Wolf: (10:30)
Well thank you, Mr. President. And we’re here today as a testament to your leadership and determination to secure our nation’s borders. In recent weeks, as you’ve mentioned, our country has witnessed an all out attack against our law enforcement. Thankfully you have not stood idly by, instead you’re supporting the brave law enforcement officers who sacrificed so much for all of us every day. And nowhere is that support as important as it is here at the Southwest border. Border security is Homeland security, the first priority of any nation is to ensure the sovereignty by protecting the integrity of its borders.
Chad Wolf: (11:03)
Since you ensure the sovereignty by protecting the integrity of its borders. Mr. President, you have disregarded the ineffective conventional wisdom put forth by folks in DC and instead listen to your operators, and they have been very clear. They want an effective and lasting border wall system, and you’ve responded by making available over $15 billion to fund this critical capability, and so your support of the men and women of DHS and CVP is beyond comparison. Others such as General Semonite and Commissioner Morgan will talk to you about the attributes of the wall, but let me just focus on a few key issues that you also brought up that goes into securing our borders, not only the border wall system, but we are also closing loopholes that have served as magnets over the last three years, enticing migrants to take a very dangerous journey north to the US and enter our country illegally.
Chad Wolf: (11:52)
We have entered into a number of game-changing agreements with our northern triangle partners to stem the flow of illegal migrants as well. We’ve demanded, you specifically have demanded Mexico step up their efforts, and we’re seeing more and more migrants being turned around at Mexico’s southern border before they reach our own.
Chad Wolf: (12:11)
We’re also addressing the abuse, as you mentioned, of the asylum system, clamping down on the use of frivolous asylum claims to illegally obtain work authorization here in the US, and we’re also disrupting and dismantling dangerous cartels by leveraging the unique capabilities of the United States Coast Guard as well as the United States Navy. And we’re attacking these criminals where they’re most vulnerable, and that’s at the sea.
Chad Wolf: (12:33)
And perhaps most importantly, you took decisive action to restrict travel to the US during COVID-19, and you’ve taken recent action to put American workers first as we reopen the economy. So Mr. President, I want to thank you once again for your support of the men and women of DHS, also for your support of law enforcement across the country, but particularly here along the southwest border. We look forward to continuing our work on the border wall system and making the border even more secure.
Donald Trump: (12:59)
Thank you very much. When we first came, there was a thing called the caravan, and you’d have caravans, you’d have these massive amounts of people coming up and they’d be coming from sometimes Honduras or Guatemala, El Salvador, other countries. They’d come through those countries sometimes, but thousands and thousands of people I guess the largest one we saw was maybe 15,000. That’s a lot of people, and very dangerous for those people, too. Things that happened on that journey up were brutal, and it was a long journey, but we don’t have that anymore because they know they can’t get through, and when they know they can’t get through, they don’t want to go through that. So we’ve told other countries, you can’t do that. You can’t have caravans and they listened to us. So it’s a big difference right now. Tremendous difference. Mark, please.
Chad Wolf: (13:52)
Yes, sir. So a couple of things. First, I want to echo what the secretary said, sir. I want to say as commissioner of CBP, thank you. Thank you. From early on, you listened where others before you had not. I think Brandon Judd could testify to that early on Brandon, he was engaging you and you engaged the experts who are on the front lines every day, risking their lives for this country. And you asked them, what do you need? And one of the things they said is we need an effective border wall system. And Mr. President, you have delivered that. And to echo what the secretary said, too, we also concur that border security is national security. It’s just common sense. We have to know who and what is coming through our borders and to our borders, and we have to be able to defend that.
Chad Wolf: (14:36)
And with every new mile of new wall system, the operational capacity of CBP, specifically a border patrol, is increased. Our ability to enforce the rule of law has increased, our ability to maintain integrity of the immigration system has increased, our ability to improve border security has increased, and our ability to shape and drive the behavior of the cartels has also increased. Our ability to impede, deny, and stop the vast threats that we have have increased because of your leadership in providing us the tools like the wall system.
Chad Wolf: (15:10)
I think this is also important, and we’ve talked about this before. It’s not just a wall. I keep saying wall system on purpose because what you have delivered is something that has not been delivered before. It’s not just a bunch of steel in the ground. It’s that plus access roads, technology, other attributes that really makes it an effective wall system and gives us a capability that we have not had before, and that’s why I stay true to the fact when I’m asked.
Chad Wolf: (15:39)
The 220 miles of wall system we have in right now are 220 new miles of wall system. That gives us an enhanced capability that we never had. Stopping drugs out the border? That’s what we should do. That helps reduce the tens of thousands of American citizens have died every years at the hands of the cartels smuggling drugs across this border. Stopping human smuggling at the border prevents and reduces the ability of women and children to be lost, abandoned, and further exploited by the cartels. Stopping criminals and gangs at the border reduces violent crime in every city in this country. Stopping infectious disease like COVID-19 at the border has saved countless lives, and that is due to your leadership.
Chad Wolf: (16:27)
And that’s why we say all the time that every town, city and state is a border town, border city, border state. Everything that touches our border touches every city, town, and state in this country, and that’s why we have said and we will continue to say borders matter. The wall matters.
Chad Wolf: (16:47)
I want to end by saying a special thanks also to a General Todd Semonite. It’s been an incredible relationship that we’ve had. His wall team as we call it and the CVP’s wall team, we’ve worked together for the past few years making this happen, and I am 100% convinced that we will reach that 450 miles by the end of the calendar year.
Donald Trump: (17:12)
I think we’ll do that. Todd, go ahead, please.
Todd: (17:12)
Well, sir, first of all, thanks for having us in. And the Corps of Engineers is exceptionally honored to work on one of these largest infrastructure projects in our country. And the commissioner talked about the team. I mean, it goes to Secretary Wolf, all the CVP agents, phenomenal people. We couldn’t do this alone. And it’s just a very noble calling to be able to put this in place.
Todd: (17:28)
Just to be able to talk to you a little bit. Again, this is a four-state program about $15 billion, 49 different projects that are being done right now, and I’m just going to give you a quick couple of numbers here. There are 220 miles that are complete. They’re done. We’re doing about a mile a day right now. Under contract right now being built, put in the ground, steel and concrete, 384 miles. And then we’ve got another 129 miles that are actually, we’re working through real estate, we’re working through the design and we continue to get all that in. So that would be somewhere over 700 miles that’s already under work and being done. There’s 144,000 panels that are being put in the ground. These are eight feet wide, 30 or 18 feet high already in place in concrete. So it’s a pretty massive system. Today we’re actually looking at what we call the Yuma primary. This is 26 miles, cost about $267 million, 51,000 cubic yards of concrete, about 36,000 tons of steel. And sir, what we’ve got in this particular project about 17,000 panels, so a lot going on there.
Todd: (18:30)
And I just want to end by looking at the elected officials of Arizona, and it goes to the other states as well. CVP, the Corps of Engineers, we’re absolutely committed to do this, where it is environmentally less impact as possible. We want to put as many jobs as we can into the local community. We want to continue to make sure that we are going overboard on COVID compliance. Right now, our contractors have some of the most stringent measures in America before to make sure that before they ever walk on the workspace, they’re being as safe as they absolutely can. And if there’s anything else that we need to do to be able to make sure we’re very close with your constituents, we are committed to do that. So sir, we’re honored to be here and we’ve got a lot of great things going on.
Donald Trump: (19:11)
Great job. Thank you very much, Todd. Brandon, could I ask you to say a few words? Because you were the ones that said … you told me we need a wall. You got to get the wall.
Brandon: (19:20)
Well, first, President, actions speak much louder than words. You are the only president in my 23-year career that has actually come down to the border multiple times to look at and assess what actually needs to be done. Your agents, I normally call them my agents, but they are your agents. Your agents appreciate the fact that you’ve gone above and beyond, well, more than any other president in the history of my career. Your agents want two things. They want border security, which is security for the entire United States, and they want security for their family, for their friends, and for their loved ones.
Brandon: (19:59)
You built the strongest economy in my lifetime. We trust that you’re going to continue to build that economy. Pandemic hit. Nobody saw it coming. Nobody could have predicted it. You will build that economy and we trust that you will build that economy. You’ve done more to secure the border. We are at historic lows and you’ve done it twice, not just once. None of your predecessors were able to do that.
Brandon: (20:25)
You’ve talked with the men and women of the border patrol. You’ve invited me to the Oval Office on multiple occasions to consult with what the boots on the ground want. They have consistently told you walls in strategic locations work. It allows us to dictate where traffic goes. It allows us to be a lot more effective. You, not your predecessors, have done that. You built the economy, you have provided border security, and you continue to do it, and we continue to look forward to work with you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (20:57)
Thank you, Brandon, very much. It was very interesting because Brandon was telling me right at the beginning, we needed the wall and what kind of wall we need, and you have to have a vision through the wall if you don’t have the vision through. And then we met and you all agreed, but we met with your people. We had a various design competitions for … I said if we’re going to build it, let’s build it right. And we had design competitions. The wall that was hardest to get over the wall that was impossible to climb or certainly very hard, and this was the hardest. We built the top of the line, but you were really a great help. Thank you, Brandon, very much.
Brandon: (21:34)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (21:34)
So a man that’s been so much has just done a great job for the area and very is so into security of this great state of Arizona, and I just think he’s really a fantastic guy. The governor. Could you say a few words, please, Doug?
Doug Ducey: (21:49)
Sure. [inaudible 00:21:50]. One, welcome back to Arizona, Mr. President. It’s good to have you here. And I want to say to be down on the border for years, Arizonans have heard empty-
Doug Ducey: (22:03)
For years, Arizonians have heard empty talk about the border. And this is the first administration that has taken action. So I want to say how grateful I am for the partnership with Homeland Security, how your Border Patrol, your Customs and Border Protection and ICE have all been helpful. The Army Corps of Engineers, not only what they’re doing on the wall, but what they’re doing for potential search capacity around COVID-19. I think shows the best of what’s possible when there’s a partnership between the federal government and the state government. And it’s been your leadership that has allowed there to be real action.
Doug Ducey: (22:41)
And in 2014, when I was first elected, there were large areas of Arizona’s border that were wide open and unprotected. And on this 220 mile stretch, now there is border security, which is national security, and that will stop drug cartels, human traffickers, and child sex traffickers. And your top folks have partnered with the Border Strike Force in Arizona. And as a result, we’ve kept dangerous drugs and this poison out of our schools and neighborhoods, as well as protecting people who are not being trafficked over the border. So I’m grateful, and I know there’s more to do because the borders longer than 220 miles. I look forward to working with you in the coming years to complete the job.
Donald Trump: (23:30)
Yeah. We will have it mostly complete by the end of the year. And we may add a little and then we may find spots where we want to add, but we’ll have everything we wanted pretty much by the end of the year. That’s great, Doug. Thank you. Great job you’re doing.
Doug Ducey: (23:42)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (23:43)
And Martha, you’re there and you’ve been such a help and I appreciate it. And I know how you feel about border security maybe better than anybody.
Martha McSally: (23:53)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (23:53)
But I just want to thank you for your help. Please say a few words.
Martha McSally: (23:54)
Absolutely, Mr. President. Welcome back to Arizona. It was an honor to fly with you on Air force One and bring you back for this commemoration. I feel like we were just here recently for the hundredth mile. And so it just shows with the partnership that’s been talked about here, how quickly you’ve been able to enact this border wall system to give the agents everything that they need in order to secure our border. And I know our mayor knows the impact of that on this community and the sector chief here. Border security is national security. It’s also health security. I think people realized now in this pandemic, that borders matter.
Martha McSally: (24:28)
And they matter for the safety and security of this state and the whole nation, and the drugs that have been flowing through easily that are impacting and killing loved ones around America, it has to stop. And this border wall system is a huge part of stopping the cartel activity, stopping that poison from coming across and giving these agents everything they need as we support law enforcement for everything they do in order to keep us safe at the federal and at the local level. So thanks for your leadership and your partnership on this. Welcome back to Arizona.
Donald Trump: (24:59)
Thank you very Much. Thanks, Martha. Great job. Appreciate it. Debbie, go ahead. Come on. Let’s see if you can do it again.
Debbie Lesko: (25:10)
I’m on the ground. I’m on Judiciary Committee and Homeland Security Committee. So I see firsthand how many of my democratic colleagues really want to prioritize illegal immigrants over U.S. citizens. And they really do want open borders. I mean, I don’t understand it, but they do. And so there’s such a clear difference between you and your future opponent in this issue, and Democrats as whole. I mean, I sat in Judiciary Committee when Chairman Jerry Nadler said that the border patrol officers were guilty of child abuse. And I think they said to Mr. Morgan, that he was guilty of negligent homicide. I mean, the insanity of what they’re saying, and the difference is so clear between what the Democrats want for the future of our nation, and what you are doing to make us safe and make our country safe. And I want to thank you for that.
Donald Trump: (26:15)
Well, I think one of the all time classics, and I’m sure you all remember it well, was they had a picture of a cage in the New York Times and other places, and it was a cage for children and they said, President Trump built it and how horrible it was. And they still talk about it, even though they know it’s not true. And somebody wrote in no, no, that cage was built in 2014 by President Obama. I guess you could say Biden, but I don’t think Biden knew too much about it, frankly. He still doesn’t, but it was built by president Obama. And Mark called, who was around this business for a long time.
Donald Trump: (26:54)
He said that wasn’t built by President Trump, that was built by President Obama in 2014. They gave me an exact date. Actually, they gave me the date it was constructed, meaning a series of cages. And I’ve sort of never forgot that. And they still say that. They still take that same picture. That’s where they get called, the fake news, and it’s too bad because they ought to straighten it out. It would be so good for our country, but no, that was built in 2014. I never forgot it. Somehow I never forgot it. Anyway, Mr. Mayor, would like to say something?
Chad Wolf: (27:24)
Thank you very much, Mr. President, and thanks again for coming back to Yuma. But thank you more importantly for last year, when you helped us through a big surge of the central American families. Where the folks with DHS really stepped up and addressed the very specific concern we had. Now, if you fast forwarded that situation to today, and those families were coming through with COVID, that would be 5,200 people coming through my community, potentially with COVID. So its simple math. The wall prevents people from coming, that prevents the number exposures we can have to COVID. So from local perspective, that helps our community, but the men and women of DHS that live here, they’re our residents, they’re our friends, they’re our family members. And it’s very personal and very poignant fact for us to have those kinds of protections in place. So thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (28:14)
Well, you have to see San Diego. So on the other side of San Diego is a tremendously big problem with COVID and other things. And they wanted that wall so badly. You don’t hear this about California. They wanted that wall. They were calling. Everybody was going. I won’t embarrass them by saying who called, but people that didn’t want the wall outside, wanted the wall. And I built the wall and it worked 100%. You know what I’m talking about. And then I see one of the politicians two weeks later, they should take down the wall, by the way, it works so well. But he was saying they should have taken down the wall, but now they don’t even say that, because now it has stopped COVID, it stopped everything. It stopped the whole deal and you’ve had it. And you see the experience and we’re going to take a good look at a big chunk that we have right in your backyard right here. And I know it’s made a big difference for Yuma, and that’s great. You’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. Chief, would you like to say something?
Susan Smith: (29:16)
Yes, sir. Welcome Mr. President to Yuma. And I really first want to thank you very much for your support of law enforcement, local and federal. It’s much needed right now, and it’s appreciated. I can tell you, I worked on the road back in the early 2000s, and I understand firsthand the calls for service related to undocumented immigrants and how high those calls for service were. And then after the border enhancement security measures were put into place, I can tell you that we saw a marked decline in many of those crimes associated with undocumented immigrants, such as load vehicles coming across with drugs and humans, human trafficking, stolen vehicles and other crimes related. So it’s very much appreciated and it has helped with the security in Yuma County. One thing I want you to take away is that Yuma County is a very unique community in that all of the law enforcement work very collaboratively together from our federal state and local partners. So I hope you get that takeaway when you leave here.
Donald Trump: (30:22)
Thank you very much. Appreciate it. I look forward to seeing it. Please.
James W. Carroll: (30:26)
Thank you, Mr. President. As your principal drug advisor, we first told you about China and fentanyl coming in from over there. You took decisive action, and you held China accountable. We explained about South American drugs coming up through the Caribbean. And you had secretary Esper doing surge out at seed to prevent the boats from bringing the drugs into our country. And as we’re talking about today, when we talked about the Southwest border, you already knew it, but you knew to took action and you did it. And you are now taking tough stance here at the Southwest border. We talked about treatment and we talked about the need to make sure that people get help. You committed more funds than any other president in history.
James W. Carroll: (31:08)
You also talked about the importance of preventing kids from going down this path on prevention. You committed more funds than any other president in history, and you did everything with one purpose in mind, and that is to save more American lives, and you have done it. For 30 years, drug deaths were going up. Last year prior to COVID, first time in three decades, the number of Americans dying from a drug overdose went down and that’s because of all the action you have taken on treatment prevention and stopping drugs from coming into our country and killing our children. It’s been a great honor to be able to work for you in this capacity and see your passion for saving American lives.
Donald Trump: (31:52)
That was really nice. I appreciate that very much. We are working very hard on it, so I appreciate you doing a great job too.
James W. Carroll: (31:57)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (31:57)
Thank you. Please.
Chad Wolf: (31:59)
Mr. President, thank you for visiting Yuma Sector Border Patrol. The agents here, the men and women of this sector have put in tireless days, the past several years and the recent surge across the Southwest border. Here in this sector, even though Yuma is a small sector, the second smallest sector on the Southwest border, less than 800 agents here in this sector. Even though that is the case, we were the third busiest sector on the Southwest border.
Chad Wolf: (32:27)
And what that looked like here is in 2017, we had over 12,000 apprehensions, which was more than 100% increase. One year later in 2018, we had 26,000. Again, another 100% increase. One year after that, last year of 2019, over 68,000 apprehensions here. And it takes a while for the government, for leadership represented here today, for the members, the elected officials here today, it takes a while for those resources to flow in. And the agents, we know they’re coming. We believe.
Chad Wolf: (33:03)
Flow in and the agents, we know they’re coming, we believe they’re coming, but now we know it. We see it on the ground. We see what flew in here over the past year to help us out. When we were in dire straits in this sector, we did not have the capacity we needed, facilities wise. We did not have the resources we needed, but the agents really fought through that, drove through that. And they did what was right, because every single person that was coming over here, even though yes, they broke the law, they still had to be taken care of why they were in our custody. We still had to step up and get that part done. And to do that, we leveraged state officials. We leveraged the local community. We leveraged NGOs in the area to help us, but now, thank you for your leadership because now those resources have arrived.
Chad Wolf: (33:50)
And now in this sector, we’re receiving 110 miles of new wall system. And out there right now, today is more than 60 miles already built, already completed. And that 60 miles makes a huge difference. Every single mile of new wall system that is put in and every single mile, both illegal entries in that particular area, drug smuggling in that particular area, border crime in that particular area, has decreased in every single mile that new wall system gets put in. And I thank you for the leadership. I thank everybody at the table today for leadership around the room, in order to take on this particular effort and help Yuma sector border patrol in doing what we need to do to help secure the United States. So thank you very much, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (34:39)
Thank you very much. Those are incredible numbers. And I just want to say this was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do because we had to raise a large amount of money. As you were saying, this was one of the biggest projects you’ve ever worked on. It’s a tremendous … It’s a wall, but it’s a wall that’s very big and very long and very powerful. And the Democrats didn’t want to do it. They just didn’t want to do it. No matter what, it didn’t matter. And these are people that voted in favor of it 10 years ago, but they never got it built because they didn’t know how to build it because building it is tough too. But I do that and we know how to build, but they tried to block it. They did everything in their power to block it.
Donald Trump: (35:22)
And it was very interesting because in the end, it sort of just went through and the military helped us and we were getting it built regardless, but they don’t like bringing it up. And it’s never mentioned anymore. The wall is never mentioned anymore. The reason it’s not mentioned, it’s not that we won the battle. It’s that it’s such a compelling thing to have done because you see the numbers and where that wall is going, as you’re saying, it’s like magic. You don’t have to do. Saves tremendous manpower and woman power. Saves tremendous human resources and saves lives. But they want open borders and they don’t want walls. And they fought harder than anybody I’ve ever seen. And in the end they quit. They gave up. The reason they gave up because politically it’s unacceptable to say, especially with this new disease coming in, the pandemic. The new disease coming in, a gift from China, especially when that happened, and they say, how can we be putting this?
Donald Trump: (36:30)
So they don’t want to talk about the wall anymore. They opposed it. They were strongly opposed to it. And it was interesting because you said about the wall, they’d say, no, no, we don’t need a wall. We can have airplanes flying above. We can have people taking pictures. We can have drones. They wanted drones. They said, what are you going to take pictures of everyone flowing across? They didn’t want to say, they said, no, no walls. That’s old technology, no. Walls are the greatest technology. I sort of came up with this. I’m sure somebody did before. I said, there’s two things because everything changes in the world. They change fast. Change is so fast. You do a computer and it’s obsolete in two weeks.
Donald Trump: (37:12)
But two things that have never changed a wall and a wheel. We’re going to always have wheels and we’re going to always have walls and we have the best security wall ever built. We’ll have it completed very soon. The way you said that was very nice. I appreciated the big difference that it’s made. It’s really great. Thank you very much. Thank you. We’re going to the wall now and we’re going to see a piece of the wall. We’re not going to be able to cover 500 miles of view, but we’ll be able to cover about 10 yards, but we’ll see a piece of a long wall that we’re building and you’ll see what we’re talking about. We’ll see you over there. Thank you media. Thank you."
"Jun 21, 2020","Donald Trump: (01:11)
Thank you, thank you. So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I’ve been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don’t go, don’t come, don’t do anything. Today it was like, I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we’re doing very well in Oklahoma, that’s the word. That’s the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we’re going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we’ve done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that’s an all time record. That’s an all time record. I’ve always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we’re going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd.
Donald Trump: (04:26)
And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they’re great. They are, they’re great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We’ve spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it’s submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it’s all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where’s my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he’s running, he’s great.
Donald Trump: (05:39)
But we’ll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you’re a veteran, for years and years, they’ve wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you’re a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It’s never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that’s how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number.
Donald Trump: (06:45)
And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn’t love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn’t get rid of them because they were, let’s say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let’s say, let’s just say. And so you couldn’t get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I’m going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you’re fired, get out, right? Get out.
Donald Trump: (07:37)
They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it’s happening. It’s happening, I never knew it was so deep. It’s deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We’re lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I’ve been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I’m old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn’t lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He’s in Iowa and he says it’s good to be in Idaho. No, no, you’re in Iowa. He’s in New Hampshire and he says it’s great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you’re in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn’t happened to me yet. When that happens, there’s nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia.
Donald Trump: (10:27)
I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That’s called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you’re going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child’s play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it’s called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody.
Donald Trump: (11:39)
Our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left. We just saw it outside. We just saw it outside, you saw these thugs that came along. These people, call them protesters, isn’t it beautiful, it’s so beautiful. No, they’re so wonderful. They call them the Boston Tea Party. They’re so wonderful. Yeah, they call them … You ever watch fake news, CNN, you ever watch? [inaudible 00:12:16]
Donald Trump: (12:20)
How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he’s standing in front of a building saying, “things are very peaceful here.” And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I’ve ever seen. The whole town is burning. It’s like the biggest fire. And he said, “Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it’s great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.” Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, “You got to get … you can’t protect yourselves.” I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem.
Donald Trump: (13:28)
And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn’t that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we’re not talking about some little place, we’re talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who’s radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I’d have an offer out, I said, “Anytime you want we’ll come in, we’ll straighten it out in one hour or less.” Now I may be wrong, but it’s probably better for us to just watch that disaster.
Donald Trump: (14:28)
I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we’re going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, “Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.” But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don’t complain. They’re incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don’t talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they’re not wearing their mask. You don’t hear their say, as they’re breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, “What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.”
Donald Trump: (16:08)
But you don’t hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we … I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don’t ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don’t do it, don’t do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we’re terrible. And what we’ve done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We’ve tested now 25 million people. It’s probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany’s done a lot. South Korea has done a lot.
Donald Trump: (17:46)
They called me, they said, the job you’re doing … Here’s the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you’re going to find more people, you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don’t know what’s going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man’s 10-years-old. He’s got the sniffles. He’ll recover in about 15 minutes. That’s a case, add him to it. That’s okay. That’s a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he’s very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that’s amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us.
Donald Trump: (19:04)
When you see a little kid running around say, “Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?” They don’t even know about this. Let’s open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We’re not conforming, that’s why we’re here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that.
Donald Trump: (20:32)
And I heard it for the first time two weeks ago, I said, “Well, that one, I mean, they’re only kidding.” I said, “They’re only, they’re not.” Minneapolis, you what’s going on. They’re not kidding. They got a lot of problems. They’ll have a lot of problems. Hey, it’s 1:00 o’clock in the morning and a very tough, I’ve used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, “I’m sorry, this number’s no longer working.” By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it’s a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you’re sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council’s already passed it. In Seattle, you see what’s going on there, it’s even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They’re crazy.
Donald Trump: (21:55)
So if you want to save your [inaudible 00:21:57], you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We’re a great country. You are so lucky I’m president, that’s all I can tell you.
audience: (22:19)
USA! USA! USA! USA!
Donald Trump: (22:40)
People have come up to me, say, “How do you take it?” I say, “Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?” We deal with a lot of bad people, but we’re winning. And every once in a while, I’ll have one of these days where I’m hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, “Oh, it’s COVID.” It’s this again. By the way, it’s a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, “Kung flu.” I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, “Where do you get the energy?” I say, “I don’t have a choice. I don’t have a choice.” It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might’ve seen it. So last week they called me and they say, “Sir, West Point, West Point, we’re ready.” I said, “Oh, that’s right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.”
Donald Trump: (23:59)
You know, they delayed it for six weeks because of COVID. So they delayed it and I went there. 1,106 cadets were graduated and beautiful. Beautiful [inaudible 00:00:24:14]. Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, “Sir, we’re ready to go.” I say, “Let’s go.” This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it’s beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, “Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.” So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don’t know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don’t know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay.
Donald Trump: (25:12)
But they said to me before the speech, “Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there’ll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.” Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it’s like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought.
Donald Trump: (26:03)
Helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought. So they fly over and the kids throw the hats in the air, it’s beautiful, it really is. It was a beautiful day and we’re all finished. I was on the stage for hours, hours, sun, I came home, I had a nice tan, meaning I had a nice sunburn. The sun’s [inaudible 00:26:30] like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I’m off by two minutes they’ll say, “He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he’s a liar.” These people are sick, the fake news.
Donald Trump: (26:59)
So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, “Thank goodness. Thank you very much.” Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, “Sir, are you ready?” I said, “I’m ready General, where are we going now?” You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it’s sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, ” Sir, we can now leave the stage.” I said, “Great general, let’s go, I’ll follow you,” and he goes like this, “Right here, sir,” and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, “General.” Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They’re incredible, and they do. I said, “General, I’ve got myself a problem, general.” Because I’m wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you’re walking on flat surfaces. It’s not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, “General, I have a problem,” and he didn’t understand that at first. I said, “There’s no way.” He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I’m being baked. I’m being baked like a cake. I said, “General, there’s no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.”
Donald Trump: (29:27)
It’s true. So I said, “Is there like something else around?” “Sir, the ramp is ready to go.” “Grab me sir, grab me.” I didn’t really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, “That will be a story too.” So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I’m rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really … It’s an ice skating rink, it’s brutal. So I said, “General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.” Because I can’t fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It’s true, right? “I don’t want that, general.” Now he’s standing there, big strong guy, and he’s got these shoes but they’re loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, “Okay, general, let’s go. I will only grab you if I need you. That’s not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn’t like that. I didn’t like this picture. This picture I’m sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, “General, I’m sorry,” and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn’t want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, “Here was the number one trending story.”
Donald Trump: (32:43)
I call my wife, I said, “How good was that speech? I thought it was a …” Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I’m average, but we’re having fun, we’re having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, “How good was it, darling?” She said, “You’re trending number one.” I said to our great first lady, I said, “Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I’m trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.” No no, they don’t even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson’s disease. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true.
Donald Trump: (33:48)
They say there is something wrong with our president. I’ll let you know if there’s something wrong, okay? I’ll let you know if there’s something, I’ll tell you what, there’s something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you.
Donald Trump: (34:07)
So then my wife said, “Well it wasn’t only the ramp. Did you have water?” I said, “Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn’t want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.” You’re drinking, you’re working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun’s like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That’s why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, “What does it have to do with water?” They said, “You couldn’t lift your hand up to your mouth with water.” I said, “I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what’s the problem?” She said, “Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that’s sort of expensive.” It’s silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don’t want to get water on the tie, and I don’t want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water.
Donald Trump: (35:15)
I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? Where did it come from? I look down at my tie because I’ve done it. I’ve taken water and it spills down onto your tie, doesn’t look good for a long time and frankly, the tie is never the same. So I put it up to my lip and then I say, “[inaudible 00:35:36]”, and they gave me another disease. They gave me another disease. Anyway, that’s a long story, but here’s the story. I have lived with more the ramp than the water but I have lived with the ramp and the water since I left West Point. Not one media group said I made a good speech or I made a great speech, but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier which wasn’t good in terms of COVID but they broke their barrier and they wanted to shake hands, they wanted to … I don’t want to tell anybody, but there were a couple of kids, they put out their hand, I actually shook their hand, okay? I actually shook them. Because they were excited. They were excited. They were with their president. They were excited. The most beautiful young people. Men, women, the most beautiful young people you’ve ever seen. So think of how you feel if you’re me. I go there, how did I do? “Sir, that was a great speech.” You know all my people, “Sir, that was one of your best, that was great.” I said, “That’s great, I agree, it was a good speech. I like that speech.” They don’t mention the speech but they have been going down this ramp [inaudible 00:37:36]. It’s so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They’re bad people. Bad people.
Donald Trump: (37:54)
Okay, that’s enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we’re getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn’t have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn’t do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we’re very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I’m a big believer in freedom of speech, but that’s desecration, that’s a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don’t have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist … Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, “Oh, the protesters were lovely.” Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They’d have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they’ve done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they’re wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I’ll help you, I’ll do whatever you want. I’m waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it’ll take less than an hour and it’ll all be over with and you’ll have your city back.
Donald Trump: (41:14)
Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he’s not confusing her with his sister? “Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.” That’s what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I’ll make like a speech and I’ll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn’t … It’ll say, “A comment from Joe Biden,” but he didn’t say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they’ll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, “Joe didn’t say that. Joe doesn’t even understand it.”
Donald Trump: (42:35)
If Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters 100%. Your 401(k)s, by the way, look at how we’re doing in the stock market. Just set another record with NASDAQ. NASDAQ. Your 401(k)s and money itself will be worthless. Your 401(k)s are doing very well unless I don’t want to say … If you were stupid I’d say, “Don’t sell. Don’t sell. It went down.” But we got it back up, and now NASDAQ, think of it. NASDAQ just set a record and I think you’re going to see a lot of records, and next year, if we don’t do anything stupid on November 3, you are going to have the greatest economic year we’ve ever had. That will be next year. If the Democrats gain power, than the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left, and he’s not radical left. I don’t think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he’s controlled by the radical left, and now he’s really controlled. His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. They bailed them out, they put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters, the looters and they were, they were the arsonists. They’ll say, “Oh, it’s terrible what he says about the people of our nation.” Maybe some of them aren’t even from our nation. The leftists try to do everything they can to stop us. Every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem, they’ll do anything they can to stop us. Look what happened tonight. Look at what happened tonight. Law enforcement said, “Sir, they can’t be outside. It’s too dangerous.” We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city. The mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people. Our people are not nearly as violent, but if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side. Because I know our people. I know our people, but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation. What they did tonight, I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets. You open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions. It’s a great plane. Great everything. By the way, we ordered new ones. No president wanted to do it. They thought it was luxurious [inaudible 00:45:44] wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don’t realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? “Sir, would you sign for this plane?” Now it’s actually two planes. “Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?” I said, “How old is the original or the one we have now?” “Sir, it’s 31, 32 years.” I’d see people coming in from foreign lands that can’t compete with us, rich countries but they can’t compete with the … They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, “Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do …”
Donald Trump: (46:29)
So the deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was $5.7 or $5.6 billion. Now in all fairness, it’s two planes and there’s a lot of stuff in those planes I won’t talk to you about. So I told Boeing, the head of Boeing, they said, “Sir, please, we’d like to get started on the planes,” I said, “I do too, but I’m not paying $5.6 billion, and I’m not paying $4.6 billion.” I said, ” It has to have a three on the front of it.” That’s a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation. They said, “No way.” No way. This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing is coming back. They’re coming back. Greatest company of the world and that’s their big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn’t work out. That was terrible, but the greatest. I think before that, it was the greatest company in the world. It made up a quarter, one quarter of a point, of our GDP. Think how big that is, one company. It was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they’ve gone through hell but you know what? They’re coming back, we’re ready to help them if they need it but they’re coming back in the coming [inaudible 00:47:56]. This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we’re still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we’re going to win. We’re going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, “No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.” Whatever it was, if I’m a little bit off they’ll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, “Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.” I said, “General, can you cancel the contract?” He said, “Yes sir, I’m very proud of it.” “Oh good. Cancel it.” “Okay sir.” “By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?” “Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.” “How much is it, general?” “$250 million.” I said, “What?” “Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.” “You mean if we don’t buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.” That’s not good, right? Look at these two guys, they’re looking.
Donald Trump: (49:12)
By the way, that’s like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, “$250 million?” Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I’m off by a little bit, they say, “Oh, he exaggerates.” I look at numbers all day long. That’s what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great … I say, “General. Don’t cancel. Don’t cancel. Just tell them I don’t want the planes. Don’t put anything in writing, don’t put it in writing, general.” “Why sir?” “Because I don’t want to pay 250.” True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he’s great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job.
Donald Trump: (50:03)
So here’s what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, “No way, no way, no way.” The next week they say, “No way we’re doing it.” The next week they said, “How about $5 billion?” I said, “No way. No way.” The next week they said, “$4.8.” I said, “Nope. It’s got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don’t you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don’t you understand?” I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, “$4.5 is our best offer.” “Nope. I’m not doing it. I’m not doing it. Come back when you’re ready.” A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion.
Donald Trump: (51:10)
That’s a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they’re not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, “Let’s get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they’re delinquent. For many years they’re delinquent. They haven’t been paying what they’re supposed to be paying. They’re paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,” and they say, “Yes, we think by
Donald Trump: (52:02)
And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, “No, Angela, please. Don’t say that Angela. It’s true. You know who I’m talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, “Angela, that’s a long time,” this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, “No Angela, that’s not working.” But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, “Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?” Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn’t paid. I said, “What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?” So we’re negotiating let’s see, but in the meantime, we’re reducing our troops.
Donald Trump: (52:48)
Remember this, we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we’re supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We’re supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don’t get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We’re ripped off by so many countries and we’re stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don’t want me here. They don’t want me. There are a lot of people that don’t want me. They don’t sell a lot of bombs when we’re not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It’s called the military industrial complex.
Donald Trump: (54:04)
When rioting and looting broke out in our nation’s Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, “Get them in.” After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We’re not happy. That’s going to be very expensive for DC. They’re always looking for money. “We need more money. We always need more money.” And then they don’t do the proper job. So it’s not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there.
Donald Trump: (54:54)
They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don’t worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn’t like what he said a week ago. I said, “Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody’s even asking?” We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn’t like that. A lot of people that you wouldn’t even think would care that much. I’ve had people that I said, “These are super left liberals and they didn’t like it.”
Donald Trump: (56:26)
Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we’re doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody’s coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you’ve ever seen or ever heard.
Donald Trump: (57:27)
Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they’re not looking to do you much help. ICE, they’re rough guys. they’re great Americans, but they’ll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They’ll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn’t say this, it’s not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody’s swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They’re great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth.
Donald Trump: (58:13)
And when I called them animals, I said, “They’re animals.” And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it’s more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, “These are animals.” And Nancy Pelosi said, “These are human beings. They’re not animals.” If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden’s America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that’s true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you’re seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don’t keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden’s record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what’s great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He’s been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden’s supported every globalist attack on the American worker let’s make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry.
Donald Trump: (01:00:47)
Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, “We have to make this deal with South Korea. It’s going to mean 250,000 jobs.” And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China’s entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens.
Donald Trump: (01:01:53)
When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn’t know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn’t say it. And they didn’t cover it. They didn’t cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that’s closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That’s early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID.
Donald Trump: (01:02:49)
When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He’ll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That’s been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world’s top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently… We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn’t like it. You know why he didn’t like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn’t work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it’s a little bit…
Donald Trump: (01:04:12)
Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they’re okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time.
Speaker 1: (01:05:06)
God bless you, Trump.
Donald Trump: (01:05:06)
Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That’s incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that’s why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I’m going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you’ve ever seen. I’ve already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing.
Donald Trump: (01:06:26)
And almost more incredible, he gave him 1.8 billion in green cash. Beautiful cash. And now they’re not doing so well, are they? They’re not doing so well. Someday, we’re going to get credit for this, someday, but they are waiting. Iran wants to make a deal so badly. But they’re told by Carey and all these other, they shouldn’t the Logan Act, but they’re told Carey and all these people, “Wait, because if Trump loses you’ll own America, you’re going to own it.” They’ll say you own it. So I don’t mind. I told them we can wait, but when I win, you’re going to pay a much higher price than if you made a deal [inaudible 01:07:12].
Donald Trump: (01:07:08)
I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son’s paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They’ll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that’s perfect and they’re not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don’t want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution.
Donald Trump: (01:08:13)
They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you’re sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O’Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won’t have to think back about it too much, because it won’t matter. Hopefully it won’t matter. No, Beto O’Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that’s not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it’s never been before. And that’s after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far.
Donald Trump: (01:09:11)
And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn’t have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it’s a, I don’t know if it’s an equal court, it’s almost like we’re a minority court, right? It’s almost like we’re a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We’ll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you’re the elite. They’re not the elite. You’re the elite.
Donald Trump: (01:10:13)
Somebody two days ago said, “Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.” I said, “Yeah, why do you call them the elite,” I said, “why?” “Well, they’re not elite.” I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we’ll do it one more time. We won’t even toy with them about three or four more times. We won’t. We’ll do it one more time. We’ll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger.
Donald Trump: (01:11:27)
But I’ll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I’ll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I’ll only pick from that list. Biden can’t release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn’t be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don’t understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, “You won, but you have to come back and redo it.” It’s almost like, “Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.” But we’re going to be refiling, but don’t let it get you. Everything’s going to work out really good. Everything’s going to work out good.
Donald Trump: (01:12:28)
It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, “Oh, you’re going to win DACA. You’re going to win DACA. That’s easy. You got to win DACA. That’s easy.” They all said it. And they came back and they said, “We don’t like what you did with your paperwork,” essentially. So we’re re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn’t lose. We’re going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren’t so young anymore, by the way. But we’re going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn’t even know where the hell he is. Let’s face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Donald Trump: (01:13:19)
To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don’t think that’s going to work out too well, but she’s actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn’t even want to win. She doesn’t want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she’s got no sense, no credentials. She’s got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn’t have a clue. You know it. But she’s in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let’s cancel those brand new Air Force Ones.
Donald Trump: (01:14:32)
Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don’t think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she’s telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we’re going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they’ve had it. They’ve had it.
Donald Trump: (01:15:40)
Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man’s personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he’s never met. And he frankly probably doesn’t want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else’s jobs too by the way. If I didn’t come along, we’re building auto plants, we’re building everything. And there’s never been a comeback like we’re making right now. Never been.
Donald Trump: (01:17:19)
He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn’t wanted to… Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same… Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don’t-
Donald Trump: (01:18:03)
And they don’t want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They’re not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They’ve done a terrible job and they shouldn’t be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn’t happen. It’ll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We’ve all worked too hard. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I’ve done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years.
Donald Trump: (01:19:10)
Racial justice begins with Joe Biden’s retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They’re respected by everybody. They do some job, and I’d have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He’s running on November 3rd. I don’t even know. Does he… Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against… There’s no competition that he’s got. I know he’s got James’ support. He’s got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I’d give it to James too, but he’s not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is.
Donald Trump: (01:20:36)
Also here is a man who’s respected by so many. He’s a little bit right of the people we’ve been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people.
Speaker 2: (01:21:05)
Patriot.
Donald Trump: (01:21:06)
Thank you, Tom. Great job you’re doing. We’re glad to be joined as well by a man that I’ve gotten to know. He’s done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He’s been here for a little while. He’s done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don’t want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I’ll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they’ve done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible.
Donald Trump: (01:22:56)
David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who’s got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They’re great… They are, they’re warriors. I’ll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we’ll send Jim Inhofe back, and we’ll send all of them. You’ll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they’ve been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:23:56)
So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I’m right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody’s ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we’re doing is we’re doing it again. And it’s going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don’t quite get it. We’re doing record business. It’s happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe.
Donald Trump: (01:24:59)
Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here’s what’s going to happen. Here’s what’s going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn’t stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here’s what’s happening. We’re going up. We’re going up. We’re going up. We’re going to go up. Then we’re going to hit October. We’re going to be up. We’re going to be way up. We’re not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China.
Donald Trump: (01:26:09)
But we’re going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, “Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he’s doing. I don’t believe the fake news anymore.” And you’re not going to want to lose your 401k’s. And you’re not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you’ve accumulated, whether it’s real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it’ll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I’m not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we’re going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we’re going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we’ve ever had, okay?

And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don’t have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don’t have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, “Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don’t think I want to take a chance.” You’re not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it’s the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, “Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.” And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? “Darling, I love you so much. You’ve always been a loser. You’ve always lost money. But now under President Trump, you’re one of the greatest financial minds in our country.” And all you did was keep your stock.
Donald Trump: (01:28:17)
Now, if you think you’re going to run against… Oh, they’re going crazy. They want the stock market to go down. Even if it costs them money, they want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money, and they don’t even know why. You know what, they’re smart and they’re vicious, but they don’t know why. I’m telling you, they don’t know why. What’s wrong with having the strongest military brand new in the world, [inaudible 00:10:44]? What’s wrong with having these great economic numbers? What’s wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let’s go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He’s a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it’s time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work.
Donald Trump: (01:29:14)
I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they’ve never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I’m also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we’re going to do that. It’ll be done very quickly.
Donald Trump: (01:30:55)
We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It’s very popular, but some people it’s like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it’s wrong.
Donald Trump: (01:31:59)
Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It’s a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that’s over 30%. They’re controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats’ push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you’d never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.
Donald Trump: (01:33:29)
A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That’s what’s happening, that’s what’s happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they’d see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we’ll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful.
Donald Trump: (01:35:06)
212 mile. That’s a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there’s something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, “Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.” I said, “Thank you very much.”
Donald Trump: (01:35:49)
And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It’s so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That’s happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn’t President, would have never come. We will become the world’s premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That’s already started. We’re bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America’s terrorist enemies.
Donald Trump: (01:37:08)
When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. “Sir, we’ve just taken 100%.” We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it’s damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn’t sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we’ll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, “In God we trust.” We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
Donald Trump: (01:41:26)
We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you."
